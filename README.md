# SFI model - A maritime ontology with visualization

<img src="images/logo.PNG" width="300">  


SFI_Ontology is a project for SDIR trying to make an ontology of the global SFI Coding and Classification System for marine and offshore industries.  
This project has as goal to make a knowledge graph of the system and a web-app to visualize relationship in the system.  

Documentation for RDF could be found locally on `~/SFI_Ontoloy/documentation.html`.  
Documentation for web-app and Pythonfiles below.

## Documentation for Pythonfiles
To see documentation for PythonFiles go to `PythonFiles` or click this link: [PythonFiles](PythonFiles) .

## Documentation on web-app
The web-app is a visualization of the SFI Ontology. In the app it's possible to see relations between the nodes and their positions.  

### How to start
To run the app either download/clone this repositry or go to [https://sjofartsdirektoratet.github.io/SFI_Ontology/](https://sjofartsdirektoratet.github.io/SFI_Ontology/) 

#### Run locally
`$ cd ~/SFI_Ontology`  
One change must be made for it to run locally. It is in `package.json`.  
Remove:  
`"homepage": "..."`

Then:  
`$ npm install -g serve`  
`$ npm run build`
`$ serve -s build`  
Go to [localhost:5000](localhost:5000)

The app is build with react framework and based on the library D3.js managing the data and graph representation.

### D3.js 

"D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation." [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)

The visualization is realized using a D3.tree() with radial links. The data is parsed using d3.json()(could also be csv) and is used to create a d3.hierarchy which again is used as input to the D3.tree() object. The knowledge graph itself is a SVG element. 

### Deploy updates with gh-pages
It's easy to update the app with github pages. Push your update to repository and build/deploy the page in one command.  
remember to add homepage. Then use:  
`npm run deploy`  
And github makes/updates the branch gh-pages.  
Homepage is: `https://username.github.io/reponame`
