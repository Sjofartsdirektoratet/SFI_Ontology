It is often used for risk management for an exceptional risk that, though unlikely, would have catastrophic consequences. Contingency plans are often devised by governments or businesses. For example, suppose many employees of a company are traveling together on an aircraft which crashes, killing all aboard. The company could be severely strained or even ruined by such a loss. Accordingly, many companies have procedures to follow in the event of such a disaster. The plan may also include standing policies to mitigate a disaster's potential impact, such as requiring employees to travel separately or limiting the number of employees on any one aircraft. During times of crisis, contingency plans are often developed to explore and prepare for any eventuality. During the Cold War, many governments made contingency plans to protect themselves and their citizens from nuclear attack. Examples of contingency plans designed to inform citizens of how to survive a nuclear attack include the booklets Survival Under Atomic Attack, Protect and Survive, and Fallout Protection, which were issued by the British and American governments. Today there are still contingency plans in place to deal with terrorist attacks or other catastrophes.

General insurance is typically defined as any insurance that is not determined to be life insurance. It is called property and casualty insurance in the United States and Canada and non-life insurance in Continental Europe. In the United Kingdom, insurance is broadly divided into three areas: personal lines, commercial lines and London market. The London market insures large commercial risks such as supermarkets, football players and other very specific risks. It consists of a number of insurers, reinsurers, P&I Clubs, brokers and other companies that are typically physically located in the City of London. Lloyd's of London is a big participant in this market. The London market also participates in personal lines and commercial lines, domestic and foreign, through reinsurance. products are usually designed for relatively small legal entities. These would include workers' compensation (employers liability), public liability, product liability, commercial fleet and other general insurance products sold in a relatively standard fashion to many organisations. There are many companies that supply comprehensive commercial insurance packages for a wide range of different industries, including shops, restaurants and hotels. products are designed to be sold in large quantities. This would include autos (private car), homeowners (household), pet insurance, creditor insurance and others.

A ship is subject to the law of its flag state. It is usual to say that the ship sails under the flag of the country of registration. A ship's flag state exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship's equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents. The organization which actually registers the ship is known as its registry. Registries may be governmental or private agencies. In some cases, such as the United States' Alternative Compliance Program, the registry can assign a third party to administer inspections.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth. An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days. Some entertainment, such as public executions, are now illegal in most countries. Activities such as fencing or archery, once used in hunting or war, have become spectator sports. In the same way, other activities, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work or an act of cruelty by another. The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures."}}, {"@id": "118.017 Film, development, copying", "@value": {"code": "118.017", "label": "Film,_development,_copying", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "118.020 Representation", "@value": {"code": "118.020", "label": "Representation", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "118.025 Trial trip representation", "@value": {"code": "118.025", "label": "Trial_trip_representation", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "118.030 Menus, guest lists, printed matter", "@value": {"code": "118.030", "label": "Menus,_guest_lists,_printed_matter", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "12 QUALITY ASSURANCE, GENERAL WORK, MODELS", "@value": {"code": "12", "label": "Quality_assurance,_general_work,_models", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "121 QUALITY ASSURANCE, PLANNING, WORK PREPARATION", "@value": {"code": "121", "label": "Quality_assurance,_planning,_work_preparation", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "121.001 EDP expenses", "@value": {"code": "121.001", "label": "Edp_expenses", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "121.005 Quality assurance manuals", "@value": {"code": "121.005", "label": "Quality_assurance_manuals", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "121.010 Progress plans", "@value": {"code": "121.010", "label": "Progress_plans", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "121.015 Work preparation", "@value": {"code": "121.015", "label": "Work_preparation", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "121.020 Work hours/progress control", "@value": {"code": "121.020", "label": "Work_hours/progress_control", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "122 WORK MANAGEMENT, FIRE GUARD, SUPERVISION, WATCH KEEPING", "@value": {"code": "122", "label": "Work_management,_fire_guard,_supervision,_watch_keeping", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "122.001 Hull work management", "@value": {"code": "122.001", "label": "Hull_work_management", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "122.005 Machinery work management", "@value": {"code": "122.005", "label": "Machinery_work_management", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "122.010 Pipe work management", "@value": {"code": "122.010", "label": "Pipe_work_management", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "122.015 Carpenter work management", "@value": {"code": "122.015", "label": "Carpenter_work_management", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "122.020 Work management", "@value": {"code": "122.020", "label": "Work_management", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "122.025 Fire guard", "@value": {"code": "122.025", "label": "Fire_guard", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "122.030 Watch keeping", "@value": {"code": "122.030", "label": "Watch_keeping", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "123 CLEARING & CLEANING", "@value": {"code": "123", "label": "Clearing_&_cleaning", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "123.001 Cleaning", "@value": {"code": "123.001", "label": "Cleaning", "definition": "Cleaning is the process of removing unwanted substances, such as dirt, infectious agents, and other impurities, from an object or environment.

The individual components remain separate and distinct within the finished structure, differentiating composites from mixtures and solid solutions. The new material may be preferred for many reasons. Common examples include materials which are stronger, lighter, or less expensive when compared to traditional materials. More recently, researchers have also begun to actively include sensing, actuation, computation and communication into composites, which are known as Robotic Materials. Typical engineered composite materials include: \n* Reinforced concrete and masonry \n* Composite wood such as plywood \n* Reinforced plastics, such as fibre-reinforced polymer or fiberglass \n* Ceramic matrix composites (composite ceramic and metal matrices) \n* Metal matrix composites \n* and other Advanced composite materials Composite materials are generally used for buildings, bridges, and structures such as boat hulls, , racing car bodies, shower stalls, bathtubs, storage tanks, imitation granite and cultured marble sinks and countertops.

Bilge keels increase hydrodynamic resistance to rolling, making the ship roll less. Bilge keels are passive stability systems. On commercial shipping the bilge keel is in the form of a strake, or small keel or blister, running along much of the length of the hull. They are typically fitted one on each side, low down on the side of the hull, so as not to increase the draft of the vessel. In battleships they were often quite large and used as part of the torpedo protection system. A bilge keel is often in a \"V\" shape, welded along the length of the ship at the turn of the bilge. Although not as effective as stabilizing fins, bilge keels have a major advantage in their low impact on internal ship arrangements. Unlike fins, bilge keels do not have any components inside the hull that would adversely affect cargo or mission spaces.

Metallic coatings may be decorative, protective or functional. Techniques for metallization started as early as mirror making. In 1835, Justus von Liebig discovered the process of coating a glass surface with metallic silver, making the glass mirror one of the earliest items being metallized. Plating other non-metallic objects grew rapidly with introduction of ABS plastic. Because a non-metallic object tends to be a poor electrical conductor, the object's surface must be made conductive before plating can be performed. The plastic part is first etched chemically by a suitable process, such as dipping in a hot chromic acid-sulfuric acid mixture. The etched surface is sensitised and activated by first dipping in tin(II) chloride solution, then palladium chloride solution. The processed surface is then coated with electroless copper or nickel before further plating. This process gives useful (about 1 to 6 kgf/cm or 10 to 60 N/cm or 5 to 35 lbf/in) adhesion force, but is much weaker than actual metal-to-metal adhesion strength. Vacuum metallizing involves heating the coating metal to its boiling point in a vacuum chamber, then letting condensation deposit the metal on the substrate's surface. Resistance heating, electron beam, or plasma heating is used to vaporize the coating metal. Vacuum metallizing was used to deposit aluminum on the large glass mirrors of reflecting telescopes, such as with the Hale telescope. Thermal spray processes are often referred to as metallizing. Metals applied in such a manner provide corrosion protection to steel for decades longer than paint alone. Zinc and aluminum are the most commonly used materials for metallizing steel structures. Cold sprayable metal technology is a metallizing process that seamlessly applies cold sprayable or puttyable metal to almost any surface. The composite metal consists of two (waterbased binder) or three different ingredients: metal powder, binder and hardener. The mixture of the ingredients is cast or sprayed on the substrate at room temperature. The desired effect and the necessary final treatment define the thickness of the layer, which normally varies between 80 and 150 \u00b5m."}}, {"@id": "278 EXTERNAL CATHODIC PROTECTION", "@value": {"code": "278", "label": "External_cathodic_protection", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "278.001 Hull/rudder anodes", "@value": {"code": "278.001", "label": "Hull/rudder_anodes", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "278.005 Sea chest anodes", "@value": {"code": "278.005", "label": "Sea_chest_anodes", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "278.010 Impressed current systems", "@value": {"code": "278.010", "label": "Impressed_current_systems", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "278.012 Impressed current anodes", "@value": {"code": "278.012", "label": "Impressed_current_anodes", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "278.014 Reference cell", "@value": {"code": "278.014", "label": "Reference_cell", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "278.016 Control unit", "@value": {"code": "278.016", "label": "Control_unit", "definition": "The control unit (CU) is a component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that directs the operation of the processor.

Toilets can be with or without flushing water (flush toilet or dry toilet). They can be set up for a sitting posture or for a squatting posture (squat toilet). Flush toilets are usually connected to a sewer system in urban areas and to septic tanks in isolated areas. Dry toilets are connected to a pit, removable container, composting chamber, or other storage and treatment device. Toilets are commonly made of ceramic (porcelain), concrete, plastic, or wood. In private homes, the toilet, sink, bath, or shower may be in the same room. Another option is to have one room for body washing (bathroom) and another for the toilet and handwashing sink (toilet room). Public toilets consist of one or more toilets (and commonly urinals) which are available for use by the general public. Portable toilets or chemical toilets may be brought in for large and temporary gatherings. Many poor households in developing countries use very basic, and often unhygienic toilets, for example simple pit latrines and bucket toilets which are usually placed in outhouses. Globally, nearly one billion people have no access to a toilet at all, and are forced to do open defecation (particularly in India). Diseases transmitted via the fecal-oral route or via water, such as cholera and diarrhea, can be spread by open defecation. They can also be spread by unsafe toilets which cause pollution of surface water or groundwater. Historically, sanitation has been a concern from the earliest stages of human settlements. The Sustainable Development Goal Number 6 calls for \"adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation by 2030\".

Air filters are used in applications where air quality is important, notably in building ventilation systems and in engines. Some buildings, as well as aircraft and other human-made environments (e.g., satellites and space shuttles) use foam, pleated paper, or spun fiberglass filter elements. Another method, air ionizers, use fibers or elements with a static electric charge, which attract dust particles. The air intakes of internal combustion engines and air compressors tend to use either paper, foam, or cotton filters. Oil bath filters have fallen out of favour aside from niche uses.

In the United States ultra low #2 diesel is the common fuel used. It is dyed red to show that it is road-tax exempt. In most markets of the United States heating oil is the same specification of fuel as on-road un-dyed diesel. An oil burner is a part attached to an oil furnace, water heater, or boiler. It provides the ignition of heating oil/biodiesel fuel used to heat either air or water via a heat exchanger. The fuel is atomized into a fine spray usually by forcing it under pressure through a nozzle which gives the resulting flame a specific flow rate, angle of spray and pattern (variations of a cone shape). This spray is usually ignited by an electric spark with the air being forced through around it at the end of a blast tube, by a fan driven by the oil burner motor. The fuel pump is typically driven via a coupling connecting its shaft to that of the motor's. Oil burners also include combustion-proving devices to prevent out-of-control combustion - Primary Control; Safety Control; Cad Cell Control; Master Control; Fire-Eye Control are all common names for the 'combustion safety control'. In the United States residential home heating oil market the \"vaporizing gun burner\" is the most common mechanical device used to heat a home or small commercial forced air space with. Depending on the manufacturer these simple burners will see a lifespan if regularly maintained for decades. Currently, old installations from the 1950s and 1960s are still in operation today if they received regular maintenance. The maintenance involved in a gun burner usually is a replacement of the nozzle used to atomize the fuel, replacing the filter located at the air handler, replacing the fuel filter on the heating oil system from the tank, cleaning out any soot or deposits in the heat exchanger of the furnace, and ensuring the system is in good working order, and also involves checking and adjusting the fuel-air mixture for efficiency with a combustion analyzer. If a heating oil burner runs out of oil it often must be primed to be restarted. Priming involves purging any air from the fuel lines so that a steady flow of oil can find its way to the burner. If an oil burner wears out it can usually be upgraded and replaced with a more efficient modern burner. If the heat exchanger wears out that requires a new furnace. Oil furnaces will last nearly forever if maintained regularly ensuring the heat exchanger is vacuumed out and cleaned. Oil burners deposit soot in the heat exchanger which is an un-even insulator. The heat distribution in the heat exchanger is un-even, causing wear on this critical steel part causing an eventual cracking. Annual or every other year tune-ups guarantee this wear is far reduced. Oil furnace lifespans of fifty to seventy-five years with regular service are not uncommon compared to an average wear out of natural gas furnaces every twenty years."}}, {"@id": "376.005 Scrubbers", "@value": {"code": "376.005", "label": "Scrubbers", "definition": "Scrubbers is a 1982 British drama film directed by Mai Zetterling and starring Amanda York and Chrissie Cotterill.

The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. The computer industry used the term \"central processing unit\" as early as 1955. Traditionally, the term \"CPU\" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry. The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory) and execution of instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components. Most modern CPUs are microprocessors, where the CPU is contained on a single metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chip. An IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory, peripheral interfaces, and other components of a computer; such integrated devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip (SoC).

Air filters are used in applications where air quality is important, notably in building ventilation systems and in engines.

Another method, air ionizers, use fibers or elements with a static electric charge, which attract dust particles. The air intakes of internal combustion engines and air compressors tend to use either paper, foam, or cotton filters. Oil bath filters have fallen out of favour aside from niche uses.

Disposable ones are made solely from polystyrene foam (such as is a disposable coffee cup) about 2 cm or one inch thick. Most reusable ones have molded-in handles; a few have shoulder straps.

Some piezoelectric transducers can also serve as a sound projector, but not all have this capability, and some may be destroyed if used in such a manner. A hydrophone can detect airborne sounds, but will be insensitive because it is designed to match the acoustic impedance of water, a denser fluid than air. Sound travels 4.3 times faster in water than in air, and a sound wave in water exerts a pressure 60 times that exerted by a wave of the same amplitude in air.

It is common for general purpose types to be programmable; however, many remain as static machines with only a limited number or no changeable parameters. Electronic data loggers have replaced chart recorders in many applications. One of the primary benefits of using data loggers is the ability to automatically collect data on a 24-hour basis. Upon activation, data loggers are typically deployed and left unattended to measure and record information for the duration of the monitoring period. This allows for a comprehensive, accurate picture of the environmental conditions being monitored, such as air temperature and relative humidity.

The primary function of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage, current, and frequency to power the load. As a result, power supplies are sometimes referred to as electric power converters. Some power supplies are separate standalone pieces of equipment, while others are built into the load appliances that they power. Examples of the latter include power supplies found in desktop computers and consumer electronics devices. Other functions that power supplies may perform include limiting the current drawn by the load to safe levels, shutting off the current in the event of an electrical fault, power conditioning to prevent electronic noise or voltage surges on the input from reaching the load, power-factor correction, and storing energy so it can continue to power the load in the event of a temporary interruption in the source power (uninterruptible power supply). All power supplies have a power input connection, which receives energy in the form of electric current from a source, and one or more power output connections that deliver current to the load.

Upon activation, data loggers are typically deployed and left unattended to measure and record information for the duration of the monitoring period. This allows for a comprehensive, accurate picture of the environmental conditions being monitored, such as air temperature and relative humidity.

A sensor is always used with other electronics. Sensors are used in everyday objects such as touch-sensitive elevator buttons (tactile sensor) and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base, besides innumerable applications of which most people are never aware. With advances in micromachinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the uses of sensors have expanded beyond the traditional fields of temperature, pressure or flow measurement, for example into MARG sensors. Moreover, analog sensors such as potentiometers and force-sensing resistors are still widely used. Applications include manufacturing and machinery, airplanes and aerospace, cars, medicine, robotics and many other aspects of our day-to-day life. There are a wide range of other sensors, measuring chemical & physical properties of materials. A few examples include optical sensors for Refractive index measurement, vibrational sensors for fluid viscosity measurement and electro-chemical sensor for monitoring pH of fluids. A sensor's sensitivity indicates how much the sensor's output changes when the input quantity being measured changes. For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1  cm when the temperature changes by 1 \u00b0C, the sensitivity is 1 cm/\u00b0C (it is basically the slope dy/dx assuming a linear characteristic). Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature thermometer inserted into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer. Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages. Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology. In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly faster measurement time and higher sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches. Due the increasing demand for rapid, affordable and reliable information in today's world, disposable sensors\u2014low-cost and easy\u2010to\u2010use devices for short\u2010term monitoring or single\u2010shot measurements\u2014have recently gained growing importance.

More complex periscopes using prisms or advanced fiber optics instead of mirrors and providing magnification operate on submarines and in various fields of science.

RC clocks may include any feature available for a clock, such as alarm function, display of ambient temperature and humidity, broadcast radio reception, etc. One common style of radio-controlled clock uses time signals transmitted by dedicated terrestrial longwave radio transmitters, which emit a time code that can be demodulated and displayed by the radio controlled clock. The radio controlled clock will contain an accurate time base oscillator to maintain timekeeping if the radio signal is momentarily unavailable. Other radio controlled clocks use the time signals transmitted by dedicated transmitters in the shortwave bands. Systems using dedicated time signal stations can achieve accuracy of a few tens of milliseconds. GPS satellite receivers also internally generate accurate time information from the satellite signals.

Sighting the height of a landmark can give a measure of distance off and, held horizontally, a sextant can measure angles between objects for a position on a chart. A sextant can also be used to measure the lunar distance between the moon and another celestial object (such as a star or planet) in order to determine Greenwich Mean Time and hence longitude.

Modern electronic devices use temperature of condensation (called the dew point), or changes in electrical capacitance or resistance to measure humidity differences. The first crude hygrometer was invented by the Italian Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci in 1480 and a more modern version was created by Swiss polymath Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1755. Later, in the year 1783, Swiss physicist and Geologist Horace B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure invented the first hygrometer using human hair to measure humidity.

The most widely used type of speaker is the dynamic speaker. The sound source (e.g., a sound recording or a microphone) must be amplified or strengthened with an audio power amplifier before the signal is sent to the speaker. The dynamic speaker was invented in 1924 by Edward W. Kellogg and Chester W. Rice. The dynamic speaker operates on the same basic principle as a dynamic microphone, but in reverse, to produce sound from an electrical signal. When an alternating current electrical audio signal is applied to its voice coil, a coil of wire suspended in a circular gap between the poles of a permanent magnet, the coil is forced to move rapidly back and forth due to Faraday's law of induction, which causes a diaphragm (usually conically shaped) attached to the coil to move back and forth, pushing on the air to create sound waves. Besides this most common method, there are several alternative technologies that can be used to convert an electrical signal into sound. Speakers are typically housed in a speaker enclosure or speaker cabinet which is often a rectangular square box made of several forms of wood, or sometimes plastic. The enclosure's materials and design play an important role in the quality of the sound. The enclosure generally must be as stiff and non-resonant as practically possible. Where high fidelity reproduction of sound is required, multiple loudspeaker transducers are often mounted in the same enclosure, each reproducing a part of the audible frequency range (picture at right). In this case, the individual speakers are referred to as drivers and the entire unit is called a loudspeaker. Drivers made for reproducing high audio frequencies are called tweeters, those for middle frequencies are called mid-range drivers and those for low frequencies are called woofers. Extremely low frequencies (16Hz-~100Hz) may be reproduced by separate subwoofers. Smaller loudspeakers are found in devices such as radios, televisions, portable audio players, computers, and electronic musical instruments. Larger loudspeaker systems are used for music, sound reinforcement in theatres and concert halls, and in public address systems."}}, {"@id": "421.053 Taperecorders", "@value": {"code": "421.053", "label": "Taperecorders", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "421.055 Tools", "@value": {"code": "421.055", "label": "Tools", "definition": "A tool is an object used to extend the ability of an individual to modify features of the surrounding environment.

The computer industry used the term \"central processing unit\" as early as 1955. Traditionally, the term \"CPU\" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry. The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory) and execution of instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components. Most modern CPUs are microprocessors, where the CPU is contained on a single metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chip.

The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded reliably to reproduce the original digital data. Modems can be used with almost any means of transmitting analog signals from light-emitting diodes to radio. A common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data. Modems are generally classified by the maximum amount of data they can send in a given unit of time, usually expressed in bits per second (symbol bit/s, sometimes abbreviated \"bps\") or rarely in bytes per second (symbol B/s). Modems can also be classified by their symbol rate, measured in baud. The baud unit denotes symbols per second, or the number of times per second the modem sends a new signal.

The process is known as rectification, since it \"straightens\" the direction of current. Physically, rectifiers take a number of forms, including vacuum tube diodes, wet chemical cells, mercury-arc valves, stacks of copper and selenium oxide plates, semiconductor diodes, silicon-controlled rectifiers and other silicon-based semiconductor switches. Historically, even synchronous electromechanical switches and motors have been used. Early radio receivers, called crystal radios, used a \"cat's whisker\" of fine wire pressing on a crystal of galena (lead sulfide) to serve as a point-contact rectifier or \"crystal detector\". Rectifiers have many uses, but are often found serving as components of DC power supplies and high-voltage direct current power transmission systems. Rectification may serve in roles other than to generate direct current for use as a source of power. As noted, detectors of radio signals serve as rectifiers. In gas heating systems flame rectification is used to detect presence of a flame. Depending on the type of alternating current supply and the arrangement of the rectifier circuit, the output voltage may require additional smoothing to produce a uniform steady voltage. Many applications of rectifiers, such as power supplies for radio, television and computer equipment, require a steady constant DC voltage (as would be produced by a battery). In these applications the output of the rectifier is smoothed by an electronic filter, which may be a capacitor, choke, or set of capacitors, chokes and resistors, possibly followed by a voltage regulator to produce a steady voltage. More complex circuitry that performs the opposite function, that is converting DC to AC, is called an inverter."}}, {"@id": "424.035 Power transformers", "@value": {"code": "424.035", "label": "Power_transformers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "424.037 Lake transceivers", "@value": {"code": "424.037", "label": "Lake_transceivers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "424.052 Portable VHF/AM aviation frequency radio sets", "@value": {"code": "424.052", "label": "Portable_vhf/am_aviation_frequency_radio_sets", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "424.054 Portable UHF radio sets", "@value": {"code": "424.054", "label": "Portable_uhf_radio_sets", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "424.055 Mobile telephone sets", "@value": {"code": "424.055", "label": "Mobile_telephone_sets", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "424.056 Mobile telephone w/coin apparatus", "@value": {"code": "424.056", "label": "Mobile_telephone_w/coin_apparatus", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "424.058 SHF transceivers", "@value": {"code": "424.058", "label": "Shf_transceivers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "424.060 Satellite communication systems w/antenna", "@value": {"code": "424.060", "label": "Satellite_communication_systems_w/antenna", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "424.062 Telephone responders", "@value": {"code": "424.062", "label": "Telephone_responders", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "424.064 Tape recorders", "@value": {"code": "424.064", "label": "Tape_recorders", "definition": "An audio tape recorder, tape deck, or tape machine is a sound recording and reproduction device that records and plays back sounds usually using magnetic tape for storage. In its present-day form, it records a fluctuating signal by moving the tape across a tape head that polarizes the magnetic domains in the tape in proportion to the audio signal. Tape-recording devices include the reel-to-reel tape deck and the cassette deck, which uses a cassette for storage. The use of magnetic tape for sound recording originated around 1930 in Germany as paper tape with oxide lacquered to it. Prior to the development of magnetic tape, magnetic wire recorders had successfully demonstrated the concept of magnetic recording, but they never offered audio quality comparable to the other recording and broadcast standards of the time. This German invention was the start of a long string of innovations that have led to present day magnetic tape recordings. Magnetic tape revolutionized both the radio broadcast and music recording industries. It gave artists and producers the power to record and re-record audio with minimal loss in quality as well as edit and rearrange recordings with ease. The alternative recording technologies of the era, transcription discs and wire recorders, could not provide anywhere near this level of quality and functionality. Since some early refinements improved the fidelity of the reproduced sound, magnetic tape has been the highest quality analog recording medium available. As of the first decade of the 21st century, analog magnetic tape has been largely replaced by digital recording technologies."}}, {"@id": "424.066 Walkie-Talkies (citizen band)", "@value": {"code": "424.066", "label": "Walkie-talkies_citizen_band", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "424.070 Cryptography units", "@value": {"code": "424.070", "label": "Cryptography_units", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "425 CALLING/COMMAND/CREW CALL TELEPHONE PLANTS, WALKIE-TALKIES", "@value": {"code": "425", "label": "Calling/command/crew_call_telephone_plants,_walkie-talkies", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "425.001 Calling systems", "@value": {"code": "425.001", "label": "Calling_systems", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "425.002 Calling centrals", "@value": {"code": "425.002", "label": "Calling_centrals", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "425.004 Signal executants", "@value": {"code": "425.004", "label": "Signal_executants", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "425.006 Command systems", "@value": {"code": "425.006", "label": "Command_systems", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "425.008 Command centrals", "@value": {"code": "425.008", "label": "Command_centrals", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "425.012 Stationary apparatus", "@value": {"code": "425.012", "label": "Stationary_apparatus", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "425.013 Loudspeakers", "@value": {"code": "425.013", "label": "Loudspeakers", "definition": "A loudspeaker is an electroacoustic transducer; a device which converts an electrical audio signal into a corresponding sound.

The gong found its way into the Western World in the 18th century when it was also used in the percussion section of a Western-style symphony orchestra. A form of bronze cauldron gong known as a resting bell was widely used in ancient Greece and Rome, for instance in the famous Oracle of Dodona, where disc gongs were also used. Gongs broadly fall into one of three types: Suspended gongs are more or less flat, circular discs of metal suspended vertically by means of a cord passed through holes near to the top rim. Bossed or nipple gongs have a raised centre boss, or knob, and are often suspended and played horizontally. Bowl gongs are bowl-shaped and rest on cushions. The latter may be considered a member of the bell category. Gongs are made mainly from bronze or brass but there are many other alloys in use. Gongs produce two distinct types of sound. A gong with a substantially flat surface vibrates in multiple modes, giving a \"crash\" rather than a tuned note. This category of gong is sometimes called a tam-tam to distinguish it from the bossed gongs that give a tuned note. In Indonesian gamelan ensembles, some bossed gongs are deliberately made to generate in addition a beat note in the range from about 1 to 5 Hz.

(A similar device to the sea anchor is the much smaller drogue, which is instead streamed from a yacht's stern in strong winds so as to slow the boat to prevent pitchpoling or broaching)."}}, {"@id": "431.009 Warping anchors", "@value": {"code": "431.009", "label": "Warping_anchors", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "431.015 Spare anchor davits", "@value": {"code": "431.015", "label": "Spare_anchor_davits", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "431.020 Anchor washdown systems", "@value": {"code": "431.020", "label": "Anchor_washdown_systems", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432 WINDLASSES W/CHAIN STOPPERS, ROLLERS", "@value": {"code": "432", "label": "Windlasses_w/chain_stoppers,_rollers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.001 Windlasses, complete", "@value": {"code": "432.001", "label": "Windlasses,_complete", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.004 Chain messengers", "@value": {"code": "432.004", "label": "Chain_messengers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.007 Anchor winches", "@value": {"code": "432.007", "label": "Anchor_winches", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.010 Mechanical brakes", "@value": {"code": "432.010", "label": "Mechanical_brakes", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.013 Hydr. brakes", "@value": {"code": "432.013", "label": "Hydr._brakes", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.016 Windlass operating panels", "@value": {"code": "432.016", "label": "Windlass_operating_panels", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.020 Chain stoppers/rollers", "@value": {"code": "432.020", "label": "Chain_stoppers/rollers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.021 Chain scissors", "@value": {"code": "432.021", "label": "Chain_scissors", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.025 Chain gauges", "@value": {"code": "432.025", "label": "Chain_gauges", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.045 Windlass hydr. systems", "@value": {"code": "432.045", "label": "Windlass_hydr._systems", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.047 Hydr. oil pumps w/drive unit", "@value": {"code": "432.047", "label": "Hydr._oil_pumps_w/drive_unit", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.049 Hydr. oil preheaters", "@value": {"code": "432.049", "label": "Hydr._oil_preheaters", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.051 Hydr. oil coolers", "@value": {"code": "432.051", "label": "Hydr._oil_coolers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.053 Hydr. oil filters", "@value": {"code": "432.053", "label": "Hydr._oil_filters", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.055 Hydr. oil expansion tanks", "@value": {"code": "432.055", "label": "Hydr._oil_expansion_tanks", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "432.057 Hydr. oil storage tanks", "@value": {"code": "432.057", "label": "Hydr._oil_storage_tanks", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "433 COMB.

Typically a fairlead will be a ring or hook. The fairlead may be a separate piece of hardware, or it could be a hole in the structure. There are mainly two types of fairlead: Roller Fairlead & Hawse Fairlead. In Roller Fairlead, there are four rollers in total. Among them, first, two are vertically mounted rollers and the rest of the two are horizontally mounted rollers. This roller is used to guide the steel cable from a different angle. On the other hand, Hawse fairlead came from one piece of machined aluminum or cast iron with no moving parts with it. Comparing to Steel roller fairlead, Hawse fairlead is extremely simple. A fairlead can also be used to stop a straight run of line from vibrating or rubbing on another surface. An additional use on boats is to keep a loose end of line from sliding around the deck (e.g. the windward (inactive) jib sheet). If the line is meant to be moved while in the fairlead, the angle in the line created by the fairlead must be shallow to minimize friction. For larger angles a block or pulley is used as a fairlead to reduce friction. Where the line is removed from a hook fairlead before using, the angle is not an issue. While fairleads are most frequently found in nautical applications, they can be found anywhere rigging is used. In off-roading, a fairlead is used to guide the winch cable and remove lateral strain from the winch. A roller fairlead is used with steel cable and a hawse fairlead is used with synthetic cable. Fairleads are used on almost every sailboat. Even as simple a sailboat as a Sunfish has a fairlead for each of its two lines. A ring fairlead holds the halyard parallel to the mast so its cleat can be located near to the cockpit. On models without a deck block for the sheet, a hook fairlead in the forward edge of the cockpit gives the sailor options when handling the sheet. An example of hook fairlead can be seen on buildings with an angled flagstaff mounted over a door. At the base of the flagstaff is usually a hook so the flag halyard can be held parallel to the pole, and still tied off to a cleat beside the door, rather than above."}}, {"@id": "435.035 Rotor bollards", "@value": {"code": "435.035", "label": "Rotor_bollards", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "436 LOOSE MOORING EQUIPMENT", "@value": {"code": "436", "label": "Loose_mooring_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "436.001 Hawser drums", "@value": {"code": "436.001", "label": "Hawser_drums", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "436.003 Hawsers", "@value": {"code": "436.003", "label": "Hawsers", "definition": "Hawser is a nautical term for a thick cable or rope used in mooring or towing a ship.A hawser passes through a hawsehole, also known as a cat hole, located on the hawse."}}, {"@id": "436.005 Hawser bins", "@value": {"code": "436.005", "label": "Hawser_bins", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "436.010 Fenders", "@value": {"code": "436.010", "label": "Fenders", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "436.015 Heaving lines", "@value": {"code": "436.015", "label": "Heaving_lines", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "436.018 Rat guards", "@value": {"code": "436.018", "label": "Rat_guards", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "436.020 Mooring wire drums", "@value": {"code": "436.020", "label": "Mooring_wire_drums", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "436.025 Mooring wire", "@value": {"code": "436.025", "label": "Mooring_wire", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437 TOWING EQUIPMENT", "@value": {"code": "437", "label": "Towing_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.001 Towing winches", "@value": {"code": "437.001", "label": "Towing_winches", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.002 Towing wire", "@value": {"code": "437.002", "label": "Towing_wire", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.003 Towing brackets", "@value": {"code": "437.003", "label": "Towing_brackets", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.005 Towing rails", "@value": {"code": "437.005", "label": "Towing_rails", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.007 Towing hooks", "@value": {"code": "437.007", "label": "Towing_hooks", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.008 Hydr. towing eyes", "@value": {"code": "437.008", "label": "Hydr._towing_eyes", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.010 Spare wire drums", "@value": {"code": "437.010", "label": "Spare_wire_drums", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.011 Hawser drums", "@value": {"code": "437.011", "label": "Hawser_drums", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.013 Loose towing equipment, wire", "@value": {"code": "437.013", "label": "Loose_towing_equipment,_wire", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.016 Towing winch remote control", "@value": {"code": "437.016", "label": "Towing_winch_remote_control", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.020 Anchor handling tongs", "@value": {"code": "437.020", "label": "Anchor_handling_tongs", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.021 Towing pins", "@value": {"code": "437.021", "label": "Towing_pins", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.025 Combined powerpacks", "@value": {"code": "437.025", "label": "Combined_powerpacks", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.030 Stern rollers", "@value": {"code": "437.030", "label": "Stern_rollers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.032 Stern roller bearings", "@value": {"code": "437.032", "label": "Stern_roller_bearings", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "437.045 Towing winch hydr. systems", "@value": {"code": "437.045", "label": "Towing_winch_hydr._systems", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "438 COMMON HYDRAULIC OIL SYSTEM FOR ANCHORING/MOORING EQUIPMENT", "@value": {"code": "438", "label": "Common_hydraulic_oil_system_for_anchoring/mooring_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "438.001 Common hydr. systems", "@value": {"code": "438.001", "label": "Common_hydr._systems", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "438.003 Hydr. oil pumps w/drive unit", "@value": {"code": "438.003", "label": "Hydr._oil_pumps_w/drive_unit", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "438.006 Hydr. oil preheaters", "@value": {"code": "438.006", "label": "Hydr._oil_preheaters", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "438.009 Hydr. oil coolers", "@value": {"code": "438.009", "label": "Hydr._oil_coolers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "438.012 Hydr. oil filters", "@value": {"code": "438.012", "label": "Hydr._oil_filters", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "438.015 Hydr. oil expansion tanks", "@value": {"code": "438.015", "label": "Hydr._oil_expansion_tanks", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "438.018 Hydr. oil storage tanks", "@value": {"code": "438.018", "label": "Hydr._oil_storage_tanks", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "438.021 Hydr. oil separating plants", "@value": {"code": "438.021", "label": "Hydr._oil_separating_plants", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "438.030 Hydr. pump el. starter systems", "@value": {"code": "438.030", "label": "Hydr._pump_el._starter_systems", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "439 COMMON HYDR.

There are many forms of tongs adapted to their specific use. Some are merely large pincers or nippers, but most fall into these few classes: 1.  \n* Tongs that have long arms terminating in small flat circular ends of tongs and are pivoted at a joint close to the handle used to handle delicate objects. Common fire-tongs, used for picking up pieces of coal and placing them on a fire without burning fingers or getting them dirty are of this type. Tongs for grilling, tongs for serving salad or spaghetti are kitchen utensil of the same type. They provide a way to move, rotate and turn the food with delicate precision, or fetch a full serving in one grab. 2.  \n* Tongs consisting of a single band of bent metal, as in sugar tongs, most asparagus tongs (which are no longer common) and the like. Sugar tongs are usually silver, with claw-shaped or spoon-shaped ends for serving lump sugar. Asparagus tongs are usually similar but larger, with a band near the head that limits how far the tongs can expand. Asparagus tongs for serving were introduced in 18th-century England, with smaller versions for eating asparagus appearing in the 19th century. 3.  \n* Tongs in which the pivot or joint is placed close to the gripping ends are used to handle hard and heavy objects. Driller's round tongs, blacksmith's tongs or crucible tongs are of this type. Design variations include resting points so that the working end of the tongs does not come into contact with a bench surface. A myth contained in the classical Jewish text Pirkei Avot states that the first pair of tongs were created by God right before God rested on the Seventh Day. The reasoning is that a blacksmith must use a pair of tongs in order to fashion a new pair of tongs. Accordingly, God must have provided humankind with the first pair of tongs."}}, {"@id": "442.026 Blow torches", "@value": {"code": "442.026", "label": "Blow_torches", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "442.027 Max. pressure indicators", "@value": {"code": "442.027", "label": "Max._pressure_indicators", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "442.028 Loose lubricating equipment", "@value": {"code": "442.028", "label": "Loose_lubricating_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "442.030 Loose gauging instruments", "@value": {"code": "442.030", "label": "Loose_gauging_instruments", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "442.032 Misc. loose engineer's machine tools", "@value": {"code": "442.032", "label": "Misc._loose_engineer's_machine_tools", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "442.035 Electrician's tools", "@value": {"code": "442.035", "label": "Electrician's_tools", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "442.036 Soldering irons", "@value": {"code": "442.036", "label": "Soldering_irons", "definition": "A soldering iron is a hand tool used in soldering.

Cordless irons can be heated by combustion of gas stored in a small tank, often using a catalytic heater rather than a flame. Simple irons less commonly used today than in the past were simply a large copper bit on a handle, heated in a flame. Solder melts at approximately 185\u00b0C (365\u00b0F). Soldering irons are designed to reach a temperature range of 200\u00b0-480\u00b0C (392\u00b0-896\u00b0 F).

In keeping with their focus on accuracy, rifles are typically designed to be held with both hands and braced firmly against the shooter's shoulder via a buttstock for stability during shooting. Rifles are used extensively in warfare, law enforcement, hunting and shooting sports. The term was originally rifled gun, with the verb \"rifle\" referring to the early modern machining process of creating groovings with cutting tools. By the 20th century, the weapon had become so common that the modern noun \"rifle\" is now often used for any long-shaped handheld ranged weapon designed for well-aimed discharge activated by a trigger (e.g. personnel halting and stimulation response rifle, which is actually a laser dazzler). Like all typical firearms, a rifle's projectile (bullet) is propelled by the contained deflagration of a combustible propellant compound (originally black powder, later cordite, and now nitrocellulose), although other propulsive means such as compressed air are used in air rifles, which are popular for vermin control, small game hunting, competitive target shooting and casual sport shooting (\"plinking\"). The distinct feature that separates a rifle from the earlier smoothbore long guns (e.g. arquebuses, muskets) is the rifling within its gun barrel. The raised areas of a barrel's rifling are called \"lands\", which make contact with and exert torque on the projectile as it moves down the bore, imparting a spin around its longitudinal axis. When the projectile leaves the barrel, this spin persists and lends gyroscopic stability to the projectile due to conservation of angular momentum, preventing yawing and tumbling in flight, in the same way that a spirally thrown American football or rugby ball behaves. This allows the use of more elongated and aerodynamically-efficient bullets (as opposed to the spherical balls used in smoothbore muskets) and thus improves range and accuracy."}}, {"@id": "461.020 Hooking spikes/mallets", "@value": {"code": "461.020", "label": "Hooking_spikes/mallets", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "462 LONGLINES W/EQUIPMENT, NETS, HANDFISHING EQUIPMENT", "@value": {"code": "462", "label": "Longlines_w/equipment,_nets,_handfishing_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "462.001 Longline windlass", "@value": {"code": "462.001", "label": "Longline_windlass", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "462.003 Coiling apparatus", "@value": {"code": "462.003", "label": "Coiling_apparatus", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "462.005 Baiting tables", "@value": {"code": "462.005", "label": "Baiting_tables", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "462.007 Longlines baiting machines", "@value": {"code": "462.007", "label": "Longlines_baiting_machines", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "462.009 Separating machines", "@value": {"code": "462.009", "label": "Separating_machines", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "462.011 Longline dropper machines", "@value": {"code": "462.011", "label": "Longline_dropper_machines", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "462.013 Magazines", "@value": {"code": "462.013", "label": "Magazines", "definition": "A magazine is a periodical publication which is printed in gloss-coated and matte paper or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine).

All power supplies have a power input connection, which receives energy in the form of electric current from a source, and one or more power output connections that deliver current to the load. The source power may come from the electric power grid, such as an electrical outlet, energy storage devices such as batteries or fuel cells, generators or alternators, solar power converters, or another power supply.

rotation around a fixed axis (spins it in a circle), applying a force perpendicular to the axis of spin (outward) that can be very strong. The centrifuge works using the sedimentation principle, where the centrifugal acceleration causes denser substances and particles to move outward in the radial direction. At the same time, objects that are less dense are displaced and move to the center. In a laboratory centrifuge that uses sample tubes, the radial acceleration causes denser particles to settle to the bottom of the tube, while low-density substances rise to the top. There are three types of centrifuge designed for different applications. Industrial scale centrifuges are commonly used in manufacturing and waste processing to sediment suspended solids, or to separate immiscible liquids. An example is the cream separator found in dairies. Very high speed centrifuges and ultracentrifuges able to provide very high accelerations can separate fine particles down to the nano-scale, and molecules of different masses. Large centrifuges are used to simulate high gravity or acceleration environments (for example, high-G training for test pilots). Medium-sized centrifuges are used in washing machines and at some swimming pools to draw water out of fabrics. Gas centrifuges are used for isotope separation, such as to enrich nuclear fuel for fissile isotopes."}}, {"@id": "494.030 Softening tanks", "@value": {"code": "494.030", "label": "Softening_tanks", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "494.031 Concentration cookers", "@value": {"code": "494.031", "label": "Concentration_cookers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "494.033 Fish meal tanks", "@value": {"code": "494.033", "label": "Fish_meal_tanks", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "494.035 Fish oil tanks", "@value": {"code": "494.035", "label": "Fish_oil_tanks", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "494.037 Conveyors", "@value": {"code": "494.037", "label": "Conveyors", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "494.039 Decanters", "@value": {"code": "494.039", "label": "Decanters", "definition": "A decanter is a vessel that is used to hold the decantation of a liquid (such as wine) which may contain sediment.

The screw shaft can be driven by a handle or a wheel. It works by using a coarse screw to convert the rotation of the handle or drive-wheel into a small downward movement of greater force. The overhead handle usually incorporates balls as flyweights. The weights helps to maintain the momentum and thrust of the tool to make it easier to operate. The screw press was first invented and used by the Romans in the first century AD. It was used primarily in wine and olive oil production. The screwpress was also used in Gutenberg's printing press in the mid-15th century. A press for metalworking is a machine tool used to shape or cut metal by deforming it with a die. It is frequently used to punch holes in sheet metal in one operation, rather than by cutting the hole or drilling. A screw press is often used in hand book binding to help keep the covers of the book flat and parallel to the text block while the glue is drying. If used as a punch, the tool itself consists of a punch and a matching die, into which it very closely fits. Both are usually precision machined and then hardened. The material is introduced between the punch and die, and the machine operated. The punch will cut through the material in one movement by shearing it. The punch and die may be of any desired shape, so odd shaped holes and cutouts may be created. If used as a forging tool the dies can be many different shapes varying from flat to various shapes that will mold the metal to the desired configuration."}}, {"@id": "495.028 Forcemeat preserving agent mixers", "@value": {"code": "495.028", "label": "Forcemeat_preserving_agent_mixers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "495.033 Scaling machines", "@value": {"code": "495.033", "label": "Scaling_machines", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "495.035 Sorting machines", "@value": {"code": "495.035", "label": "Sorting_machines", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "495.038 Conveyors", "@value": {"code": "495.038", "label": "Conveyors", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "495.048 Hydr. oil aggregates", "@value": {"code": "495.048", "label": "Hydr._oil_aggregates", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "495.050 SW process pumps", "@value": {"code": "495.050", "label": "Sw_process_pumps", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "495.055 Surimi water pumps", "@value": {"code": "495.055", "label": "Surimi_water_pumps", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "495.060 Detaching machines", "@value": {"code": "495.060", "label": "Detaching_machines", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "495.062 Hot melt sealers", "@value": {"code": "495.062", "label": "Hot_melt_sealers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "495.063 Auto markers", "@value": {"code": "495.063", "label": "Auto_markers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "495.065 Metal detectors", "@value": {"code": "495.065", "label": "Metal_detectors", "definition": "A metal detector is an electronic instrument that detects the presence of metal nearby. Metal detectors are useful for finding metal inclusions hidden within objects, or metal objects buried underground. They often consist of a handheld unit with a sensor probe which can be swept over the ground or other objects. If the sensor comes near a piece of metal this is indicated by a changing tone in earphones, or a needle moving on an indicator. Usually the device gives some indication of distance; the closer the metal is, the higher the tone in the earphone or the higher the needle goes. Another common type are stationary \"walk through\" metal detectors used for  at access points in prisons, courthouses, and airports to detect concealed metal weapons on a person's body. The main types of metal detectors are, beat-frequency oscillation, very low frequency, pulse induction and industrial. The simplest form of a metal detector consists of an oscillator producing an alternating current that passes through a coil producing an alternating magnetic field. If a piece of electrically conductive metal is close to the coil, eddy currents will be induced (inductive sensor) in the metal, and this produces a magnetic field of its own. If another coil is used to measure the magnetic field (acting as a magnetometer), the change in the magnetic field due to the metallic object can be detected. The first industrial metal detectors were developed in the 1960s and were used extensively for mineral prospecting and other industrial applications. Uses include detecting land mines, the detection of weapons such as knives and guns (especially in airport security), geophysical prospecting, archaeology and treasure hunting. Metal detectors are also used to detect foreign bodies in food, and in the construction industry to detect steel reinforcing bars in concrete and pipes and wires buried in walls and floors."}}, {"@id": "495.067 Wrapping machines, pallets", "@value": {"code": "495.067", "label": "Wrapping_machines,_pallets", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "495.070 Control panels", "@value": {"code": "495.070", "label": "Control_panels", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "496 SHELL FACTORIES", "@value": {"code": "496", "label": "Shell_factories", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "5 EQUIPMENT FOR CREW AND PASSENGERS", "@value": {"code": "5", "label": "Equipment_for_crew_and_passengers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "50 LIFESAVING, PROTECTION & MEDICAL EQUIPMENT", "@value": {"code": "50", "label": "Lifesaving,_protection_&_medical_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "501 LIFEBOATS W/EQUIPMENT", "@value": {"code": "501", "label": "Lifeboats_w/equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "501.001 Open lifeboats", "@value": {"code": "501.001", "label": "Open_lifeboats", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "501.002 Covered lifeboats", "@value": {"code": "501.002", "label": "Covered_lifeboats", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "501.003 Partly covered lifeboats", "@value": {"code": "501.003", "label": "Partly_covered_lifeboats", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "501.004 MOB boats", "@value": {"code": "501.004", "label": "Mob_boats", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "501.005 Offshore MOB boats", "@value": {"code": "501.005", "label": "Offshore_mob_boats", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "501.007 Workboats", "@value": {"code": "501.007", "label": "Workboats", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "501.008 Rubber boats", "@value": {"code": "501.008", "label": "Rubber_boats", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "501.009 Hyperbaric lifeboats", "@value": {"code": "501.009", "label": "Hyperbaric_lifeboats", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "501.015 Shock absorbing fenders/skates", "@value": {"code": "501.015", "label": "Shock_absorbing_fenders/skates", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "501.016 Inboard motors", "@value": {"code": "501.016", "label": "Inboard_motors", "definition": "An inboard motor is a marine propulsion system for boats.

The skeg also acts as a rudder when the engine is not running. Unlike inboard motors, outboard motors can be easily removed for storage or repairs. In order to eliminate the chances of hitting bottom with an outboard motor, the motor can be tilted up to an elevated position either electronically or manually. This helps when traveling through shallow waters where there may be debris that could potentially damage the motor as well as the propeller.

Immersion suits usually have built-in feet (boots), and a hood, and either built-in gloves or watertight wrist seals.Suits manufactured by several manufacturers also include an inflatable pillow which is permanently attached high on the back, or an inflatable tube that is attached with zippers at two points on the chest, each side of the main zipper, and circles the back. When inflated, both of these devices provide enhanced stability to the wearer, so that, if conscious, allows them to have enhanced stability with the head above water, and the ability to keep wind and seas from striking the face. The inflation tube is routed from the inflatable pillow over the left shoulder of the user, and secured in a loop on the chest.Some immersion suits are manufactured with straps/clips and hooks to allow multiple survivors to attach to one another in the water. This practice keeps survivors together. As well, some suits are manufactured with built-in hoisting lanyards, to allow easier retrieval from vessels with a higher seaboard, that may have manual or mechanical hoisting capabilities. The first record of what has previously been known as a \"survival suit\" was in 1930 when a New York firm American Life Suit Corporation offered merchant and fishing firms what it called a safety suit for crews of ocean vessels. The suit came packed in a small box and was put on like a boilersuit. The ancestor of these suits was already invented in 1872 by Clark S Merriman to rescue steamship passengers. It was made from rubber sheeting and became famous by the swim records of Paul Boyton. It was essentially a pair of rubber pants and shirt cinched tight at the waist with a steel band and strap. Within the suit were five air pockets the wearer could inflate by mouth through hoses. Similar to modern-day drysuits, the suit also kept its wearer dry. This essentially allowed him to float on his back, using a double-sided paddle to propel himself, feet-forward. Additionally, he could attach a small sail to save stamina while slowly drifting to shore (because neither emergency radio transmitters nor rescue helicopters were invented yet). The first immersion suit to gain USCG approval was invented by Gunnar Guddal. Eventually the suit became accepted as essential safety gear."}}, {"@id": "503.015 Thermal protection bags", "@value": {"code": "503.015", "label": "Thermal_protection_bags", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "503.016 Life-jacket/survival suit lights", "@value": {"code": "503.016", "label": "Life-jacket/survival_suit_lights", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "503.018 Life-jacket containers", "@value": {"code": "503.018", "label": "Life-jacket_containers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "503.019 Line-throwing appliances", "@value": {"code": "503.019", "label": "Line-throwing_appliances", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "503.020 Wave dampening tanks", "@value": {"code": "503.020", "label": "Wave_dampening_tanks", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "503.030 Divers' ladders", "@value": {"code": "503.030", "label": "Divers'_ladders", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "503.031 Raft station ladders", "@value": {"code": "503.031", "label": "Raft_station_ladders", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "503.035 Rescue chutes", "@value": {"code": "503.035", "label": "Rescue_chutes", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "503.036 Safety harnesses", "@value": {"code": "503.036", "label": "Safety_harnesses", "definition": "A safety harness is a form of protective equipment designed to protect a person, animal, or object from injury or damage.

Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. Medicine has been around for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain commonly used with, or instead of, scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. As an example, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is \"variable and inconsistent\" for any condition, but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner. In contrast, alternative treatments outside the bounds not just of scientific medicine, but also outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery. This can encompass an array of practices and practitioners, irrespective of whether they are prescientific (traditional medicine and folk medicine) or modern pseudo-scientific, including chiropractic which rejects modern scientific germ theory of disease (instead believing without evidence that human diseases are caused by invisible subluxation of the bones, predominantly of the spine and less so of other bones), with just over half of chiropractors also rejecting the science of immunization."}}, {"@id": "504.041 First aid equipment", "@value": {"code": "504.041", "label": "First_aid_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "504.043 Doctors' loose instruments", "@value": {"code": "504.043", "label": "Doctors'_loose_instruments", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "504.045 Hospital furnishing", "@value": {"code": "504.045", "label": "Hospital_furnishing", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "504.050 Protection equipment", "@value": {"code": "504.050", "label": "Protection_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "504.052 Helmets", "@value": {"code": "504.052", "label": "Helmets", "definition": "A helmet is a form of protective gear worn to protect the head.

The medieval great helm covers the whole head and often is accompanied with camail protecting throat and neck as well.

In civilian life, helmets are used for recreational activities and sports (e.g. jockeys in horse racing, American football, ice hockey, cricket, baseball, camogie, hurling and rock climbing); dangerous work activities (e.g. construction, mining, riot police, fighter pilots); and transportation (e.g. motorcycle helmets and bicycle helmets).

The mask forms a sealed cover over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face. Most gas masks are also respirators, though the word gas mask is often used to refer to military equipment (such as a field protective mask). The gas mask only protects the user from digesting, inhaling and contact through the eyes (many agents affect through eye contact). Most combined gas mask filters will last around 8 hours in a nuclear biological chemical (NBC) situation. Chemical specific filters can last up to 20 hours in an NBC situation. Airborne toxic materials may be gaseous (for example, mustard gas and chlorine gas) or particulates (such as biological agents). Many filters include protection from both types. Gas masks are used in construction to protect against welding fumes, in demolition to protect against asbestos or other hazardous particles, and in the chemical industry when handling hazardous materials, as in making repairs to leaking equipment or cleaning up after spills; workers are usually issued gas masks as a precaution against leaks. During demonstrations and protests where tear gas or CS gas is employed by riot police, gas masks are commonly used by police and demonstrators alike. Aside from serving their functional purposes, gas masks are also used as emblems in industrial music, with the most notable example, the subgenre of drum and bass called neurofunk. These emblems are used by graffiti taggers because the mask protects them from the paint canister's toxic fumes, and by urban explorers venturing into environments where hazardous materials, such as asbestos, may be present. The first gas masks mostly used circular lenses made either of glass, mica or cellulose acetate. With the exception of the latter, these materials were quite brittle and needed frequent replacement. Later on, the Triplex lense style (two layers of glass and one layer of cellulose acetate in between) became more popular, and alongside the simpler cellulose acetate they became the standard into the '30s. Panoramic lenses were not popular until the '30s, but there are some examples of those being used even during the war (Austro-Hungarian 15M). Later, polycarbonate started being used for its strength. Some have one or two filters screwed (via inlets) onto to the gas mask while others have a large filter (coffee can filter) connected to the gas mask with a hose that is sometimes confused with an air-supplied respirator in which an alternate supply of fresh air (oxygen tanks) is delivered."}}, {"@id": "505.035 Smoke diving equipment", "@value": {"code": "505.035", "label": "Smoke_diving_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "505.040 Smoke diving compressor", "@value": {"code": "505.040", "label": "Smoke_diving_compressor", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "505.042 Compressor el. equipment", "@value": {"code": "505.042", "label": "Compressor_el._equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "505.045 Firemens' clothing", "@value": {"code": "505.045", "label": "Firemens'_clothing", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "506 ABC PROTECTION EQUIPMENT", "@value": {"code": "506", "label": "Abc_protection_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "506.001 Radioactivity detection equipment", "@value": {"code": "506.001", "label": "Radioactivity_detection_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "506.003 Radioactivity protection equipment", "@value": {"code": "506.003", "label": "Radioactivity_protection_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "506.005 Radioactivity decontamination equipment", "@value": {"code": "506.005", "label": "Radioactivity_decontamination_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "506.010 Biological detection equipment", "@value": {"code": "506.010", "label": "Biological_detection_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "506.013 Biological protection equipment", "@value": {"code": "506.013", "label": "Biological_protection_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "506.015 Biological decontamination equipment", "@value": {"code": "506.015", "label": "Biological_decontamination_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "506.020 Chemical detection equipment", "@value": {"code": "506.020", "label": "Chemical_detection_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "506.023 Chemical protection equipment", "@value": {"code": "506.023", "label": "Chemical_protection_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "506.025 Chemical decontamination equipment", "@value": {"code": "506.025", "label": "Chemical_decontamination_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "51 INSULATION, PANELS, BULKHEADS, DOORS, SIDESCUTTLES,SKYLIGHTS", "@value": {"code": "51", "label": "Insulation,_panels,_bulkheads,_doors,_sidescuttles,skylights", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "511 INSULATION, PARTITION BULKHEADS, PANELLING, WALLPAPER", "@value": {"code": "511", "label": "Insulation,_partition_bulkheads,_panelling,_wallpaper", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "511.001 Window recesses", "@value": {"code": "511.001", "label": "Window_recesses", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "511.002 Bulkhead/wall panelling", "@value": {"code": "511.002", "label": "Bulkhead/wall_panelling", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "511.003 Preinsulated partition bulkheads", "@value": {"code": "511.003", "label": "Preinsulated_partition_bulkheads", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "511.004 System-ceilings w/profiles", "@value": {"code": "511.004", "label": "System-ceilings_w/profiles", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "511.006 Wet-room panelling", "@value": {"code": "511.006", "label": "Wet-room_panelling", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "511.010 Wallpaper", "@value": {"code": "511.010", "label": "Wallpaper", "definition": "Wallpaper is a material used in interior decoration to decorate the interior walls of domestic and public buildings.

The smallest rectangle that can be tiled to form the whole pattern is known as the pattern repeat. Wallpaper printing techniques include surface printing, gravure printing, silk screen-printing, rotary printing, and digital printing. Wallpaper is made in long rolls which are hung vertically on a wall. Patterned wallpapers are designed so that the pattern \"repeats\", and thus pieces cut from the same roll can be hung next to each other so as to continue the pattern without it being easy to see where the join between two pieces occurs. In the case of large complex patterns of images this is normally achieved by starting the second piece halfway into the length of the repeat, so that if the pattern going down the roll repeats after 24 inches, the next piece sideways is cut from the roll to begin 12 inches down the pattern from the first.

In another sense, a tile is a construction tile or similar object, such as rectangular counters used in playing games (see tile-based game). The word is derived from the French word tuile, which is, in turn, from the Latin word tegula, meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay. Tiles are often used to form wall and floor coverings, and can range from simple square tiles to complex or mosaics. Tiles are most often made of ceramic, typically glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing, but other materials are also commonly used, such as glass, cork, concrete and other composite materials, and stone.

Beds are available in many sizes, ranging from infant-sized bassinets and cribs, to small beds for a single person or adult, to large queen and king-size beds designed for two people. While most beds are single mattresses on a fixed frame, there are other varieties, such as the murphy bed, which folds into a wall, the sofa bed, which folds out of a sofa, and the bunk bed, which provides two mattresses on two tiers as well as a ladder to get to the upper tier. Temporary beds include the inflatable air mattress and the folding camp cot. Some beds contain neither a padded mattress nor a bed frame, such as the hammock. Some beds are made especially for animals. Beds may have a headboard for resting against, and may have side rails and footboards (or \"footers\"). \"Headboard only\" beds may incorporate a \"dust ruffle\", \"bed skirt\", or \"valance sheet\" to hide the bed frame.

The name of wardrobe was then given to a room in which the wall-space was filled with closets and lockers, the drawer being a comparatively modern invention. From these cupboards and lockers the modern wardrobe, with its hanging spaces, sliding shelves and drawers, evolved slowly. Throughout the chronological changes in the form of the enclosure, it more or less retained its preset function as a place to retain a king\u2019s robe. The word has gained coinage over successive generations as an independent store for among others, preserving precious items for a ruler like gold, well highlighted in King Edward I's times. It is also a simple patio where clothes are hung from metal bars or tucked inside utility racks running from up to down. The modern wardrobe differs in one respect from the historical one for its triple partitioning: there are two linear compartments on either side with shelves as well as a middle space made up of hanging pegs and drawers, the latter being a latter-day addition, besides a clothes\u2019 press in the higher central space on level with a person\u2019s chest.

Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique in developed countries. The lower temperature lowers the reproduction rate of bacteria, so the refrigerator reduces the rate of spoilage. A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water. Optimum temperature range for perishable food storage is 3 to 5 \u00b0C (37 to 41 \u00b0F). A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a freezer. The refrigerator replaced the icebox, which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half. The first cooling systems for food involved ice. Artificial refrigeration began in the mid-1750s, and developed in the early 1800s. In 1834, the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system was built. The first commercial ice-making machine was invented in 1854. In 1913, refrigerators for home use were invented. In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. The introduction of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s. Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940. Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace. Freezer units are used in households as well as in industry and commerce. Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. The freezer-over-refrigerator style had been the basic style since the 1940s, until modern, side-by-side refrigerators broke the trend. A vapor compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator\u2013freezers and freezers. Newer refrigerators may include automatic defrosting, chilled water, and ice from a dispenser in the door. Domestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes. Among the smallest are Peltier-type refrigerators designed to chill beverages. A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about 1 m wide with a capacity of 600 L. Refrigerators and freezers may be free-standing, or built into a kitchen. The refrigerator allows the modern household to keep food fresh for longer than before. Freezers allow people to buy food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and bulk purchases save money."}}, {"@id": "541.058 Bar lockers", "@value": {"code": "541.058", "label": "Bar_lockers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "541.060 Bar counters", "@value": {"code": "541.060", "label": "Bar_counters", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "541.065 Bar stools", "@value": {"code": "541.065", "label": "Bar_stools", "definition": "Bar stools are a type of tall chair, often with a foot rest to support the feet. The height and narrowness of bar stools makes them suitable for use at bars and high tables in pubs or bars. There are many different types, construction materials and models. Bar stools are often made of wood or metal. There are bar stools with and without armrests, backs, and padding or upholstery on the seat surface. Bar stools can range from basic wooden designs to more complex ones with adjustable height. Extra tall and extra short are common features, as well as indoor bar stools and outdoor bar stools. Some bar stools have backs, while most do not. In commercial settings, swivel and floor mounted bar stools are common. Floor mounting renders the stool immovable, so it cannot be stolen or used as a weapon in a bar fight. Floor-mounted stools generally are mounted on a column, but stools with legs can also be secured to the floor using metal brackets. The normal seat height for a bar stool is 30\" (76 cm) with a 26\" (66 cm) stool being used against kitchen counters. Extra tall 36\" (91 cm) stools are increasingly used in contemporary styles with high pub tables to create a visual effect in modern interiors. Counter height bar stools have a seat height of 24\" (61cm). By comparison a conventional dining chair seat height is 18\" (46 cm).Some bar stools use polyurethane foam as padding for comfort. Bar stools can be made from rattan or bamboo and these stools can be used to create a tiki bar effect. The retro styling of the 1950 and 1960s is popular in some bars and restaurants, which use chrome and vinyl stools combined with matching benches or diner chairs. Stacking stools are often favored for their space-saving qualities. Some establishments use matching bar stools and chairs. Aluminum is often used outdoors. Stacking aluminum stools and patio chairs are used by commercial premises. Indoors, wood and upholstery are popular in traditional settings. Bar stools are used in pool or billiard halls and the style of chair customized for such use is often called a \"spectator chair\". Bar stools are used in Ireland during weekends by followers of the English Premier League, a practice which led to the creation of the pejorative term \"barstoolers\" by supporters of the League of Ireland. Bar stools are a growth area in the consumer market and online purchasing is on the increase. Bar stools can be made to order and customers can specify a wide range of fabrics and finishes as well as specifying other options such as height and custom foot rests. Both wooden and metal bar stools, including stainless and chrome styles and adjustable height features are popular."}}, {"@id": "541.070 Messroom furniture", "@value": {"code": "541.070", "label": "Messroom_furniture", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "542 OFFICE EQUIP. & SPEC.

Typically, a typewriter has an array of keys, and each one causes a different single character to be produced on the paper, by means of a ribbon with dried ink struck against the paper by a type element similar to the sorts used in movable type letterpress printing. On some typewriters, a separate type element (called a typebar) corresponds to each key; others use a single type element (such as a typeball or disc) with a different portion of it used for each character. At the end of the nineteenth century, the term typewriter was also applied to a person who used a typing machine. The first commercial typewriters were introduced in 1874, but did not become common in offices until after the mid-1880s. The typewriter quickly became an indispensable tool for practically all writing other than personal handwritten correspondence. It was widely used by professional writers, in offices, and for business correspondence in private homes. Typewriters were a standard fixture in most offices up to the 1980s. Thereafter, they began to be largely supplanted by computers. Nevertheless, typewriters remain common in some parts of the world, are required for a few specific applications, and are popular in certain subcultures. In many Indian cities and towns, typewriters are still used, especially in roadside and legal offices due to a lack of continuous, reliable electricity. The QWERTY keyboard layout, developed for typewriters, remains the standard for computer keyboards. Notable typewriter manufacturers included E.

They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and gas). Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools. Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc, and calculator functions are included in almost all personal digital assistant (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices. In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example, there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra. Graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional Euclidean space. As of 2016, basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.

The pile usually consists of twisted tufts that are typically heat-treated to maintain their structure. The term carpet is often used in a similar context to the term rug, but rugs are typically considered to be smaller than a room and not attached to the floor. Carpets are used for a variety of purposes, including insulating a person's feet from a cold tile or concrete floor, making a room more comfortable as a place to sit on the floor (e.g., when playing with children or as a prayer rug), reducing sound from walking (particularly in apartment buildings), and adding decoration or color to a room. Carpets can be made in any color by using differently dyed fibers. Carpets can have many different types of patterns and motifs used to decorate the surface. Carpets are used in industrial and commercial establishments such as retail stores and hotels and in private homes. Today, a huge range of carpets and rugs are available at many price and quality levels, ranging from inexpensive, synthetic carpets that are mass-produced in factories and used in commercial buildings to costly hand-knotted wool rugs that are used in private homes of wealthy families. Carpets can be produced on a loom quite similar to woven fabric, made using needle felts, knotted by hand (in oriental rugs), made with their pile injected into a backing material (called tufting), flatwoven, made by hooking wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric, or embroidered.

However, most ancient sculpture was brightly painted, and this has been lost. Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures, and until recent centuries large sculptures, too expensive for private individuals to create, were usually an expression of religion or politics. Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, India and China, as well as many in Central and South America and Africa.

The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its immediate predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and a still considerable, though not so extensive, investment of time to read. This sense of book has a restricted and an unrestricted sense. In the restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage that reflects the fact that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls, and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. So, for instance, each part of Aristotle's Physics is called a book. In the unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts. The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings, or photographs, or such things as crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls. In a physical book, the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines as support for ongoing entries, e.g., an account book, an appointment book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary, or a sketchbook. Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. Books may be distributed in electronic form as e-books and other formats. Although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a single scholarly subject, in library and information science monograph denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume In Search of Lost Time), in contrast to serial publications like a magazine, journal, or newspaper. An avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially, \"bookworm\". A shop where books are bought and sold is a bookshop or bookstore. Books are also sold elsewhere.

Tape-recording devices include the reel-to-reel tape deck and the cassette deck, which uses a cassette for storage. The use of magnetic tape for sound recording originated around 1930 in Germany as paper tape with oxide lacquered to it. Prior to the development of magnetic tape, magnetic wire recorders had successfully demonstrated the concept of magnetic recording, but they never offered audio quality comparable to the other recording and broadcast standards of the time. This German invention was the start of a long string of innovations that have led to present day magnetic tape recordings. Magnetic tape revolutionized both the radio broadcast and music recording industries. It gave artists and producers the power to record and re-record audio with minimal loss in quality as well as edit and rearrange recordings with ease. The alternative recording technologies of the era, transcription discs and wire recorders, could not provide anywhere near this level of quality and functionality.

Radio waves are electromagnetic waves of frequency between 30 hertz (Hz) and 300 gigahertz (GHz). They are generated by an electronic device called a transmitter connected to an antenna which radiates the waves, and received by a radio receiver connected to another antenna. Radio is very widely used in modern technology, in radio communication, radar, radio navigation, remote control, remote sensing and other applications. In radio communication, used in radio and television broadcasting, cell phones, two-way radios, wireless networking and satellite communication among numerous other uses, radio waves are used to carry information across space from a transmitter to a receiver, by modulating the radio signal (impressing an information signal on the radio wave by varying some aspect of the wave) in the transmitter. In radar, used to locate and track objects like aircraft, ships, spacecraft and missiles, a beam of radio waves emitted by a radar transmitter reflects off the target object, and the reflected waves reveal the object's location. In radio navigation systems such as GPS and VOR, a mobile receiver receives radio signals from navigational radio beacons whose position is known, and by precisely measuring the arrival time of the radio waves the receiver can calculate its position on Earth. In wireless radio remote control devices like drones, garage door openers, and keyless entry systems, radio signals transmitted from a controller device control the actions of a remote device. Applications of radio waves which do not involve transmitting the waves significant distances, such as RF heating used in industrial processes and microwave ovens, and medical uses such as diathermy and MRI machines, are not usually called radio. The noun radio is also used to mean a broadcast radio receiver. Radio waves were first identified and studied by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1886. The first practical radio transmitters and receivers were developed around 1895-6 by Italian Guglielmo Marconi, and radio began to be used commercially around 1900.

However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games). Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player. Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction. Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both. Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role. Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures.

This property, called specular reflection, distinguishes a mirror from objects that scatter light in many directions (such as flat-white paint), let it pass through them (such as a lens or prism), or absorb it. Most mirrors behave as such only for certain ranges of wavelength, direction, and polarization of the incident light; most commonly for visible light, but also for other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum from X-rays to radio waves. A mirror will generally reflect only a fraction of the incident light; even the best mirrors may scatter, absorb, or transmit a small portion of it. If the mirror's width is only a few times the wavelength of the light, a significant part of the light will also be diffracted instead. An object that is a mirror when examined at a small scale (like a bearing ball) may seem to be scattering light when examined at a larger scale. When looking at a mirror, one will see a mirror image or reflected image of objects in the environment, formed by light emitted or scattered by them and reflected by the mirror towards one's eyes. This effect gives the illusion that those objects are behind the mirror, or (sometimes) in front of it. A plane mirror will yield a real-looking undistorted image, while a curved mirror may distort, magnify, or reduce the image in various ways. A mirror is commonly used for inspecting oneself, such as during personal grooming; hence the old-fashioned name looking glass. This use, which dates from the Prehistory, overlaps with uses in decoration and architecture. Mirrors are also used to view other items that are not directly visible because of obstructions; examples include rear-view mirrors in vehicles, security mirrors in or around buildings, and dentist's mirrors. Mirrors are also used in optical and scientific apparatus such as telescopes, lasers, cameras, periscopes, and industrial machinery. The terms \"mirror\" and \"reflector\" can be used for devices that reflect other types of radiation according to the same laws. An acoustic mirror reflects sound waves, and may be used for applications such as , atmospheric studies, sonar, and . An atomic mirror reflects matter waves, and can be used for atomic interferometry and atomic holography."}}, {"@id": "547.005 Towel automats", "@value": {"code": "547.005", "label": "Towel_automats", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "547.010 Waste paper baskets", "@value": {"code": "547.010", "label": "Waste_paper_baskets", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "547.015 Ashtrays", "@value": {"code": "547.015", "label": "Ashtrays", "definition": "An ashtray is a receptacle for ash from cigarettes and cigars.

Bar stools are often made of wood or metal. There are bar stools with and without armrests, backs, and padding or upholstery on the seat surface. Bar stools can range from basic wooden designs to more complex ones with adjustable height. Extra tall and extra short are common features, as well as indoor bar stools and outdoor bar stools. Some bar stools have backs, while most do not. In commercial settings, swivel and floor mounted bar stools are common. Floor mounting renders the stool immovable, so it cannot be stolen or used as a weapon in a bar fight. Floor-mounted stools generally are mounted on a column, but stools with legs can also be secured to the floor using metal brackets. The normal seat height for a bar stool is 30\" (76 cm) with a 26\" (66 cm) stool being used against kitchen counters. Extra tall 36\" (91 cm) stools are increasingly used in contemporary styles with high pub tables to create a visual effect in modern interiors. Counter height bar stools have a seat height of 24\" (61cm). By comparison a conventional dining chair seat height is 18\" (46 cm).Some bar stools use polyurethane foam as padding for comfort. Bar stools can be made from rattan or bamboo and these stools can be used to create a tiki bar effect. The retro styling of the 1950 and 1960s is popular in some bars and restaurants, which use chrome and vinyl stools combined with matching benches or diner chairs. Stacking stools are often favored for their space-saving qualities. Some establishments use matching bar stools and chairs. Aluminum is often used outdoors. Stacking aluminum stools and patio chairs are used by commercial premises. Indoors, wood and upholstery are popular in traditional settings. Bar stools are used in pool or billiard halls and the style of chair customized for such use is often called a \"spectator chair\".

Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer 25\u201338 mm (1\u20131.5 inches) of a homogeneous, high water content food item. The development of the cavity magnetron made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength (microwaves). American engineer Percy Spencer is generally credited with inventing the modern microwave oven after World War II from radar technology developed during the war. Named the \"Radarange\", it was first sold in 1946. Raytheon later licensed its patents for a home-use microwave oven that was first introduced by Tappan in 1955, but these units were still too large and expensive for general home use. Sharp Corporation introduced the first microwave oven with a turntable between 1964 and 1966. The countertop microwave oven was first introduced in 1967 by the Amana Corporation. After Sharp introduced low-cost microwave ovens affordable for residential use in the late 1970s, their use spread into commercial and residential kitchens around the world. In addition to their use in cooking food, microwave ovens are used for heating in many industrial processes. Microwave ovens are a common kitchen appliance and are popular for reheating previously cooked foods and cooking a variety of foods. They are also useful for rapid heating of otherwise slowly prepared foodstuffs, which can easily burn or turn lumpy when cooked in conventional pans, such as hot butter, fats, chocolate or porridge. Unlike conventional ovens, microwave ovens usually do not directly brown or caramelize food, since they rarely attain the necessary temperatures to produce Maillard reactions. Exceptions occur in rare cases where the oven is used to heat frying-oil and other oily items (such as bacon), which attain far higher temperatures than that of boiling water. Microwave ovens have limited roles in professional cooking, because the boiling-range temperatures of a microwave will not produce the flavorful chemical reactions that frying, browning, or baking at a higher temperature will.

Linen textiles appear to be some of the oldest in the world; their history goes back many thousands of years. Dyed flax fibers found in a cave in Southeastern Europe (present-day Georgia) suggest the use of woven linen fabrics from wild flax may date back over 30,000 years. Linen was used in ancient civilizations including Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt. There are many references to linen throughout the Bible, reflecting the textile's entrenched presence in human cultures. In the 18th century and beyond, the linen industry was important in the economies of several countries in Europe as well as the American colonies.

Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique in developed countries. The lower temperature lowers the reproduction rate of bacteria, so the refrigerator reduces the rate of spoilage. A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water. Optimum temperature range for perishable food storage is 3 to 5 \u00b0C (37 to 41 \u00b0F). A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a freezer. The refrigerator replaced the icebox, which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half. The first cooling systems for food involved ice. Artificial refrigeration began in the mid-1750s, and developed in the early 1800s. In 1834, the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system was built. The first commercial ice-making machine was invented in 1854. In 1913, refrigerators for home use were invented. In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. The introduction of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s. Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940. Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace. Freezer units are used in households as well as in industry and commerce. Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. The freezer-over-refrigerator style had been the basic style since the 1940s, until modern, side-by-side refrigerators broke the trend. A vapor compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator\u2013freezers and freezers. Newer refrigerators may include automatic defrosting, chilled water, and ice from a dispenser in the door. Domestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes. Among the smallest are Peltier-type refrigerators designed to chill beverages. A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about 1 m wide with a capacity of 600 L.

These numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number of individual models produced.They are the principal means of transportation in many regions. They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys, general fitness, military and police applications, courier services, bicycle racing, and bicycle stunts. The basic shape and configuration of a typical upright or \"safety bicycle\", has changed little since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885. However, many details have been improved, especially since the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design. These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for many types of cycling. The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings, pneumatic tires, chain-driven sprockets and tension-spoked wheels."}}, {"@id": "565.010 Scooters", "@value": {"code": "565.010", "label": "Scooters", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "565.015 Trolleys", "@value": {"code": "565.015", "label": "Trolleys", "definition": "Trolley may refer to:"}}, {"@id": "566 HELICOPTER PLATFORMS W/EQUIPMENT", "@value": {"code": "566", "label": "Helicopter_platforms_w/equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "566.001 Helicopter deck", "@value": {"code": "566.001", "label": "Helicopter_deck", "definition": "A helicopter deck (or helo deck) is a helicopter pad on the deck of a ship, usually located on the stern and always clear of obstacles that would prove hazardous to a helicopter landing. In the United States Navy, it is commonly and properly referred to as the flight deck. In the UK's Fleet Air Arm, landing on is usually achieved by first lining up on the port quarter parallel to the ship's heading, then once the deck motion is deemed to be acceptable the pilot sidesteps the aircraft laterally using a white painted line (the bum line) as a reference. Shipboard landing for some helicopters is assisted though use of a haul-down device that involves attachment of a cable to a probe on the bottom of the aircraft prior to landing. Tension is maintained on the cable as the helicopter descends, assisting the pilot with accurate positioning of the aircraft on the deck; once on deck locking beams close on the probe, locking the aircraft to the flight deck. This device was pioneered by the Royal Canadian Navy and was called \"Beartrap\". The U.S. Navy implementation of this device, based on Beartrap, is called the \"RAST\" system (for Recovery Assist, Secure and Traverse) and is an integral part of the LAMPS Mk III (SH-60B) weapons system. A secondary purpose of the haul-down device is to equalize electrostatic potential between the helicopter and ship. The whirling rotor blades of a helicopter can cause large electrical charges to build up on the airframe, large enough to cause injury to shipboard personnel should they touch any part of the helicopter as it approaches the deck. This was depicted in the 1990 film The Hunt for Red October, when Jack Ryan is flown out to a submarine by helicopter. Ryan is lowered to the submarine, but brushes the officer charged with trying to hook him who receives a minor injury. Coaxial rotor helicopters in flight are highly resistant to side-winds, which makes them suitable for shipboard use, even without a rope-pulley landing system. Marine and offshore helicopter decks on board offshore oil platforms and ships are typically regulated by the rules defined within CAP 437, which defines standards for the design, marking, and lighting of marine/offshore helicopter decks, and is produced by the Civil Aviation Authority. The largest marine helicopter decks will accommodate the Boeing CH-47 Chinook, which requires a  of 30 metres (98 ft), and has a weight of 21.3 tons. More typical for vessels would be decks that will accommodate the Sikorsky S-92 with a D value of 21 metres (69 ft) and 11.9 tons."}}, {"@id": "566.002 Helideck safety equipment", "@value": {"code": "566.002", "label": "Helideck_safety_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "566.003 Helideck loose firefighting equip.", "@value": {"code": "566.003", "label": "Helideck_loose_firefighting_equip.", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "566.004 Foam firefighting equipment", "@value": {"code": "566.004", "label": "Foam_firefighting_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "566.005 Marker lights, floodlights", "@value": {"code": "566.005", "label": "Marker_lights,_floodlights", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "566.006 Helideck plaitwork", "@value": {"code": "566.006", "label": "Helideck_plaitwork", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "566.009 Helideck FO tanks", "@value": {"code": "566.009", "label": "Helideck_fo_tanks", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "566.010 Helideck FO pumps", "@value": {"code": "566.010", "label": "Helideck_fo_pumps", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "566.015 Turning motor, guides", "@value": {"code": "566.015", "label": "Turning_motor,_guides", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "566.020 Couplings", "@value": {"code": "566.020", "label": "Couplings", "definition": "A coupling is a device used to connect two shafts together at their ends for the purpose of transmitting power.

This contrasts with spark-ignition engines such as a petrol engine (gasoline engine) or gas engine (using a gaseous fuel as opposed to petrol), which use a spark plug to ignite an air-fuel mixture. Diesel engines work by compressing only the air. This increases the air temperature inside the cylinder to such a high degree that atomised diesel fuel injected into the combustion chamber ignites spontaneously. With the fuel being injected into the air just before combustion, the dispersion of the fuel is uneven; this is called a heterogeneous air-fuel mixture. The torque a diesel engine produces is controlled by manipulating the air-fuel ratio (\u03bb); instead of throttling the intake air, the diesel engine relies on altering the amount of fuel that is injected, and the air-fuel ratio is usually high. The diesel engine has the highest thermal efficiency (engine efficiency) of any practical internal or external combustion engine due to its very high expansion ratio and inherent lean burn which enables heat dissipation by the excess air. A small efficiency loss is also avoided compared with non-direct-injection gasoline engines since unburned fuel is not present during valve overlap and therefore no fuel goes directly from the intake/injection to the exhaust. Low-speed diesel engines (as used in ships and other applications where overall engine weight is relatively unimportant) can reach effective efficiencies of up to 55%. Diesel engines may be designed as either two-stroke or four-stroke cycles. They were originally used as a more efficient replacement for stationary steam engines. Since the 1910s, they have been used in submarines and ships. Use in locomotives, trucks, heavy equipment and electricity generation plants followed later. In the 1930s, they slowly began to be used in a few automobiles. Since the 1970s, the use of diesel engines in larger on-road and off-road vehicles in the US has increased. According to Konrad Reif, the EU average for diesel cars accounts for half of newly registered cars. The world's largest diesel engines put in service are 14-cylinder, two-stroke watercraft diesel engines; they produce a peak power of almost 100 MW each."}}, {"@id": "601.001 Main diesel engine,

heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid. The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. This pushing force is transformed, by a connecting rod and flywheel, into rotational force for work. The term \"steam engine\" is generally applied only to reciprocating engines as just described, not to the steam turbine. Steam engines are external combustion engines, where the working fluid is separated from the combustion products. The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle. In general usage, the term steam engine can refer to either complete steam plants (including boilers etc.) such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines, or may refer to the piston or turbine machinery alone, as in the beam engine and stationary steam engine. Steam-driven devices were known as early as the aeolipile in the first century AD, with a few other uses recorded in the 16th and 17th century. Thomas Savery's dewatering pump used steam pressure operating directly on the water. The first commercially successful engine that could transmit continuous power to a machine was developed in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen. James Watt made a critical improvement by removing spent steam to a separate vessel for condensation, greatly improving the amount of work obtained per unit of fuel consumed. By the 19th century, stationary steam engines powered the factories of the Industrial Revolution. Steam engines replaced sail for ships, and steam locomotives operated on the railways. Reciprocating piston type steam engines were the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines in commercial usage. Steam turbines replaced reciprocating engines in power generation, due to lower cost, higher operating speed, and higher efficiency."}}, {"@id": "618.005 Thrust shafts", "@value": {"code": "618.005", "label": "Thrust_shafts", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "618.007 Thrust bearings", "@value": {"code": "618.007", "label": "Thrust_bearings", "definition": "A thrust bearing is a particular type of rotary bearing.

Thrust bearings come in several varieties. \n* Thrust ball bearings, composed of bearing balls supported in a ring, can be used in low thrust applications where there is little axial load. \n* Cylindrical thrust roller bearings consist of small cylindrical rollers arranged flat with their axes pointing to the axis of the bearing. They give very good carrying capacity and are cheap, but tend to wear due to the differences in radial speed and friction which is higher than with ball bearings. \n* Tapered roller thrust bearings consist of small tapered rollers arranged so that their axes all converge at a point on the axis of the bearing. The length of the roller and the diameter of the wide and the narrow ends and the angle of rollers need to be carefully calculated to provide the correct taper so that each end of the roller rolls smoothly on the bearing face without skidding. These are the type most commonly used in automotive applications (to support the wheels of a motor car for example), where they are used in pairs to accommodate axial thrust in either direction, as well as radial loads. They can support greater thrust loads than the ball type due to the larger contact area, but are more expensive to manufacture. \n* Spherical roller thrust bearings use asymmetrical rollers of spherical shape, rolling inside a house washer with a raceway with spherical inner shape.

They are also used in the main and tail rotor blade grips of RC (radio controlled) helicopters. Thrust bearings are used in cars because the forward gears in modern car gearboxes use helical gears which, while aiding in smoothness and noise reduction, cause axial forces that need to be dealt with.

Like other bearings they permanently rotate between parts, but they are designed to support a predominantly axial load. Thrust bearings come in several varieties. \n* Thrust ball bearings, composed of bearing balls supported in a ring, can be used in low thrust applications where there is little axial load. \n* Cylindrical thrust roller bearings consist of small cylindrical rollers arranged flat with their axes pointing to the axis of the bearing. They give very good carrying capacity and are cheap, but tend to wear due to the differences in radial speed and friction which is higher than with ball bearings. \n* Tapered roller thrust bearings consist of small tapered rollers arranged so that their axes all converge at a point on the axis of the bearing. The length of the roller and the diameter of the wide and the narrow ends and the angle of rollers need to be carefully calculated to provide the correct taper so that each end of the roller rolls smoothly on the bearing face without skidding. These are the type most commonly used in automotive applications (to support the wheels of a motor car for example), where they are used in pairs to accommodate axial thrust in either direction, as well as radial loads. They can support greater thrust loads than the ball type due to the larger contact area, but are more expensive to manufacture. \n* Spherical roller thrust bearings use asymmetrical rollers of spherical shape, rolling inside a house washer with a raceway with spherical inner shape. They can accommodate combined radial and axial loads and also accommodate misalignment of the shafts. They are often used together with radial spherical roller bearings. Spherical roller thrust bearings offer the highest load rating density of all thrust bearings. \n* Fluid bearings, where the axial thrust is supported on a thin layer of pressurized liquid\u2014these give low drag. \n* Magnetic bearings, where the axial thrust is supported on a magnetic field. This is used where very high speeds or very low drag is needed, for example the Zippe-type centrifuge. Thrust bearings are commonly used in automotive, marine, and aerospace applications. They are also used in the main and tail rotor blade grips of RC (radio controlled) helicopters. Thrust bearings are used in cars because the forward gears in modern car gearboxes use helical gears which, while aiding in smoothness and noise reduction, cause axial forces that need to be dealt with.

sailboats, windsurfers, ice boats, and even sail-powered land vehicles. Sails may be made from a combination of woven materials\u2014including canvas or polyester cloth, laminated membranes or bonded filaments\u2014usually in a three- or four-sided shape. A sail provides propulsive force via a combination of lift and drag, depending on its angle of attack\u2014its angle with respect to the apparent wind. Apparent wind is the air velocity experienced on the moving craft and is the combined effect of the true wind velocity with the velocity of the sailing craft. Angle of attack is often constrained by the sailing craft's orientation to the wind or point of sail. On points of sail where it is possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind, the sail may act as an airfoil, generating propulsive force as air passes along its surface\u2014just as an airplane wing generates lift\u2014which predominates over aerodynamic drag retarding forward motion. The more that the angle of attack diverges from the apparent wind as a sailing craft turns downwind, the more drag increases and lift decreases as propulsive forces, until a sail going downwind is predominated by drag forces. Sails are unable to generate propulsive force if they are aligned too closely to the wind. Sails may be attached to a mast, boom or other spar or may be attached to a wire that is suspended by a mast. They are typically raised by a line, called a halyard, and their angle with respect to the wind is usually controlled by a line, called a sheet. In use, they may be designed to be curved in both directions along their surface, often as a result of their curved edges. Battens may be used to extend the trailing edge of a sail beyond the line of its attachment points. Other non-rotating airfoils that power sailing craft include wingsails, which are rigid wing-like structures, and kites that power kite-rigged vessels, but do not employ a mast to support the airfoil and are beyond the scope of this article."}}, {"@id": "64 BOILERS, STEAM & GAS GENERATORS", "@value": {"code": "64", "label": "Boilers,_steam_&_gas_generators", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "641 MAIN BOILERS", "@value": {"code": "641", "label": "Main_boilers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "641.001 Main boilers, complete", "@value": {"code": "641.001", "label": "Main_boilers,_complete", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "641.003 Main boiler casings, foundations, bolts", "@value": {"code": "641.003", "label": "Main_boiler_casings,_foundations,_bolts", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "641.005 Reheaters", "@value": {"code": "641.005", "label": "Reheaters", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "641.007 Economizers", "@value": {"code": "641.007", "label": "Economizers", "definition": "Economizers (US and Oxford spelling), or economisers (UK), are mechanical devices intended to reduce energy consumption, or to perform useful function such as preheating a fluid.

Gas generators of this type are used to power turbopumps in rocket engines, and are used by some auxiliary power units to power electrical generators and hydraulic pumps. Another common use of the term is in the Industrial gases industry, where gas generators are used to produce gaseous chemicals for sale.For example, the chemical oxygen generator, which delivers breathable oxygen at a controlled rate over a prolonged period. During World War II, portable gas generators that converted coke to producer gas were used to power vehicles as a way of alleviating petrol shortages.

An air compressor is a specific type of gas compressor. Compressors are similar to pumps: both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible; while some can be compressed, the main action of a pump is to pressurize and transport liquids. Many compressors can be staged, that is, the fluid is compressed several times in steps or stages, to increase discharge pressure. Often, the second stage is physically smaller than the primary stage, to accommodate the already compressed gas. Each stage further compresses the gas and increases pressure. Those that are powered by an electric motor can also be controlled using a VFD or power inverter, however many (hermetic and semi-hermetic) compressors can only work at certain speeds, since they may include built-in oil pumps. The oil pumps are connected to the same shaft that drives the compressor and forces oil into the compressor and motor bearings. At low speeds, insufficient quantities or no oil is forced into the bearings, eventually leading to bearing failure, while at high speeds, excessive amounts of oil may be lost from the bearings and compressor and potentially into the discharge line due to splashing. Eventually the oil runs out and the bearings are left unlubricated, again leading to failure, and the oil may contaminate the refrigerant, air or other working gas."}}, {"@id": "649.005 Compressor drive units", "@value": {"code": "649.005", "label": "Compressor_drive_units", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "649.007 Air preheaters", "@value": {"code": "649.007", "label": "Air_preheaters", "definition": "An air preheater (APH) is any device designed to heat air before another process (for example, combustion in a boiler) with the primary objective of increasing the thermal efficiency of the process. They may be used alone or to replace a recuperative heat system or to replace a steam coil. In particular, this article describes the combustion air preheaters used in large boilers found in thermal power stations producing electric power from e.g. fossil fuels, biomass or waste. For instance, as the Ljungstr\u00f6m air preheater has been attributed worldwide fuel savings estimated to 4,960,000,000 tons of oil, \"few inventions have been as successful in saving fuel as the Ljungstr\u00f6m Air Preheater\", marked as the 44th International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The purpose of the air preheater is to recover the heat from the boiler flue gas which increases the thermal efficiency of the boiler by reducing the useful heat lost in the flue gas. As a consequence, the flue gases are also conveyed to the flue gas stack (or chimney) at a lower temperature, allowing simplified design of the conveyance system and the flue gas stack. It also allows control over the temperature of gases leaving the stack (to meet emissions regulations, for example).

Air filters are used in applications where air quality is important, notably in building ventilation systems and in engines. Some buildings, as well as aircraft and other human-made environments (e.g., satellites and space shuttles) use foam, pleated paper, or spun fiberglass filter elements. Another method, air ionizers, use fibers or elements with a static electric charge, which attract dust particles. The air intakes of internal combustion engines and air compressors tend to use either paper, foam, or cotton filters. Oil bath filters have fallen out of favour aside from niche uses. The technology of air intake filters of gas turbines has improved significantly in recent years, due to improvements in the aerodynamics and fluid dynamics of the air-compressor part of the gas turbines."}}, {"@id": "741.007 Silencers", "@value": {"code": "741.007", "label": "Silencers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "741.009 De-icers", "@value": {"code": "741.009", "label": "De-icers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "741.011 Water separators", "@value": {"code": "741.011", "label": "Water_separators", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "743 EXHAUST GAS SYSTEMS FOR PROPULSION MACHINERY", "@value": {"code": "743", "label": "Exhaust_gas_systems_for_propulsion_machinery", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "743.001 Silencers/spark arresters", "@value": {"code": "743.001", "label": "Silencers/spark_arresters", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "743.003 Main engine silencers", "@value": {"code": "743.003", "label": "Main_engine_silencers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "743.005 Main engine spark arresters", "@value": {"code": "743.005", "label": "Main_engine_spark_arresters", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "743.006 Compensators", "@value": {"code": "743.006", "label": "Compensators", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "743.007 Suspensions/absorbers", "@value": {"code": "743.007", "label": "Suspensions/absorbers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "743.010 Exhaust pipe insulation", "@value": {"code": "743.010", "label": "Exhaust_pipe_insulation", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "744 EXHAUST GAS SYSTEMS FOR MOTOR AGGREGATES", "@value": {"code": "744", "label": "Exhaust_gas_systems_for_motor_aggregates", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "744.001 Silencers/spark arresters", "@value": {"code": "744.001", "label": "Silencers/spark_arresters", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "744.003 Aux. machinery silencers", "@value": {"code": "744.003", "label": "Aux._machinery_silencers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "744.005 Aux. machinery spark arresters", "@value": {"code": "744.005", "label": "Aux._machinery_spark_arresters", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "744.006 Compensators", "@value": {"code": "744.006", "label": "Compensators", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "744.007 Suspensions/absorbers", "@value": {"code": "744.007", "label": "Suspensions/absorbers", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "744.020 Salinometers", "@value": {"code": "744.020", "label": "Salinometers", "definition": "A salinometer is a device designed to measure the salinity, or dissolved salt content, of a solution.

Dissolved oxygen in feedwater will cause serious corrosion damage in a boiler by attaching to the walls of metal piping and other equipment and forming oxides (like rust). Dissolved carbon dioxide combines with water to form carbonic acid that may cause further corrosion. Most deaerators are designed to remove oxygen down to levels of 7 ppb by weight or less, as well as essentially eliminating carbon dioxide. The deaerators in the steam generating systems of most thermal power plants use low pressure steam obtained from an extraction point in their steam turbine system. However, the steam generators in many large industrial facilities such as petroleum refineries may use whatever low-pressure steam is available. Deaerators are also used to remove dissolved gases from products such as food, personal care products, cosmetic products, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals to increase the dosing accuracy in the filling process, to increase product shelf stability, to prevent oxidative effects (e.g. discolouration, changes of smell or taste, rancidity), to alter pH, and to reduce packaging volume."}}, {"@id":

processing units", "@value": {"code": "792.031", "label": "Central_processing_units", "definition": "A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor or main processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that executes instructions that make up a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. The computer industry used the term \"central processing unit\" as early as 1955. Traditionally, the term \"CPU\" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry. The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory) and execution of instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components. Most modern CPUs are microprocessors, where the CPU is contained on a single metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chip. An IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory, peripheral interfaces, and other components of a computer; such integrated devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip (SoC). Some computers employ a multi-core processor, which is a single chip or \"socket\" containing two or more CPUs called \"cores\". Array processors or vector processors have multiple processors that operate in parallel, with no unit considered central. Virtual CPUs are an abstraction of dynamical aggregated computational resources."}}, {"@id": "792.033 Interface input equipment", "@value": {"code": "792.033", "label": "Interface_input_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "792.035 Interface output equipment", "@value": {"code": "792.035", "label": "Interface_output_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "792.037 Peripheral equipment", "@value": {"code": "792.037", "label": "Peripheral_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "792.039 Secondary storages", "@value": {"code": "792.039", "label": "Secondary_storages", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "792.050 TV supervising plants", "@value": {"code": "792.050", "label": "Tv_supervising_plants", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "792.051 TV cameras", "@value": {"code": "792.051", "label": "Tv_cameras", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "792.053 TV monitors", "@value": {"code": "792.053", "label": "Tv_monitors", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "792.055 TV control units", "@value": {"code": "792.055", "label": "Tv_control_units", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "792.057 TV lighting equipment", "@value": {"code": "792.057", "label": "Tv_lighting_equipment", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "793 AUTOM.

"803.001", "label": "Bilge_pumps", "definition": "A bilge pump is a water pump used to remove bilge water. Since fuel can be present in the bilge, electric bilge pumps are designed to not cause sparks. Electric bilge pumps are often fitted with float switches which turn on the pump when the bilge fills to a set level. Since bilge pumps can fail, use of a backup pump is often advised. The primary pump is normally located at the lowest point of the bilge, while the secondary pump would be located somewhat higher. This ensures that the secondary pump activates only when the primary pump is overwhelmed or fails, and keeps the secondary pump free of the debris in the bilge that tends to clog the primary pump. Ancient bilge force pumps had a number of common uses. Depending on where the pump was located in the hull of the ship, it could be used to suck in sea water into a live fish tank to preserve fish until the ship was docked and the fish ready to be sold. Another use of the force pump was to combat fires. Water would again be sucked in through the bottom of the hull, and then pumped onto the blaze. Yet another suggested use for a force pump was to dispel water from a ship. The pump would be placed near the bottom of the hull so as to suck water out of the ship. Force pumps were used on land as well. They could be used to bring water up from a well or to fill high placed tanks so that water could be pressure pumped from these tanks. These tanks were for household use and/or small-scale irrigation. The force pump was portable and could therefore, as on ships, be used to fight fire. Force pumps could be made of either wood or bronze. Based on ancient texts, it seems that bronze was the preferred material since it lasted longer and was more easily transported. Wood was easier to build, put together, and repair but was not as durable as bronze. Because these were high-value objects, few are found in shipwrecks; they were often recovered after the ship sank. Force pumps were fairly simple in their construction consisting of a cylinder, a piston, and a few valves. Water would fill the cylinder after which the piston would descend into the cylinder, causing the water to move to a higher placed pipe. The valve would close, locking the water into the higher pipe, and then propelling it in a jet stream."}}, {"@id": "803.005 Bilge ejectors", "@value": {"code": "803.005", "label": "Bilge_ejectors", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "803.007 Bilge wells", "@value": {"code": "803.007", "label": "Bilge_wells", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "803.009 Changeover wells", "@value": {"code": "803.009", "label": "Changeover_wells", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "803.010 Emergency bilge pumps", "@value": {"code": "803.010", "label": "Emergency_bilge_pumps", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "803.012 Bilge Self suction ejectors", "@value": {"code": "803.012", "label": "Bilge_self_suction_ejectors", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "803.020 Bilge water filters", "@value": {"code": "803.020", "label": "Bilge_water_filters", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "803.025 Bilge water separators", "@value": {"code": "803.025", "label": "Bilge_water_separators", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "803.027 Bilge sludge pumps", "@value": {"code": "803.027", "label": "Bilge_sludge_pumps", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "803.029 Bilge sludge ejectors", "@value": {"code": "803.029", "label": "Bilge_sludge_ejectors", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "803.031 Bilge sludge tanks", "@value": {"code": "803.031", "label": "Bilge_sludge_tanks", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "804 GUTTER PIPES OUTSIDE ACCOMMODATION", "@value": {"code": "804", "label": "Gutter_pipes_outside_accommodation", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "804.001 Gutter pipe drain tanks", "@value": {"code": "804.001", "label": "Gutter_pipe_drain_tanks", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "804.005 Gutter pipe filters", "@value": {"code": "804.005", "label": "Gutter_pipe_filters", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "81 FIRE & LIFEBOAT ALARM, FIRE FIGHTING & WASH DOWN SYSTEMS", "@value": {"code": "81", "label": "Fire_&_lifeboat_alarm,_fire_fighting_&_wash_down_systems", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "811 FIRE DETECTION, FIRE & LIFEBOAT ALARM SYSTEMS", "@value": {"code": "811", "label": "Fire_detection,_fire_&_lifeboat_alarm_systems", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "811.001 Fire/lifeboat alarm plant", "@value": {"code": "811.001", "label": "Fire/lifeboat_alarm_plant", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "811.003 Fire alarm centrals", "@value": {"code": "811.003", "label": "Fire_alarm_centrals", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "811.005 Smoke detectors", "@value": {"code": "811.005", "label": "Smoke_detectors", "definition": "A smoke detector is a device that senses smoke, typically as an indicator of fire. Commercial security devices issue a signal to a fire alarm control panel as part of a fire alarm system, while household smoke detectors, also known as smoke alarms, generally issue a local audible or visual alarm from the detector itself or several detectors if there are multiple smoke detectors interlinked. Smoke detectors are housed in plastic enclosures, typically shaped like a disk about 150 millimetres (6 in) in diameter and 25 millimetres (1 in) thick, but shape and size vary. Smoke can be detected either optically (photoelectric) or by physical process (ionization); detectors may use either, or both, methods. Sensitive alarms can be used to detect, and thus deter, smoking in areas where it is banned. Smoke detectors in large commercial, industrial, and residential buildings are usually powered by a central fire alarm system, which is powered by the building power with a battery backup. Domestic smoke detectors range from individual battery-powered units, to several interlinked mains-powered units with battery backup; with these interlinked units, if any unit detects smoke, all trigger even if household power has gone out. The risk of dying in a home fire is cut in half in homes with working smoke alarms. The US National Fire Protection Association reports 0.53 deaths per 100 fires in homes with working smoke alarms compared to 1.18 deaths without (2009\u20132013).

The pump intake is either connected to the public underground water supply piping, or a static water source (e.g., tank, reservoir, lake). The pump provides water flow at a higher pressure to the sprinkler system risers and hose standpipes. A fire pump is tested and listed for its use specifically for fire service by a third-party testing and listing agency, such as UL or FM Global. The main code that governs fire pump installations in North America is the National Fire Protection Association's NFPA 20 Standard for the Installation of Stationary Fire Pumps for Fire Protection. Fire pumps function either by an electric motor or a diesel engine, or, occasionally a steam turbine. If the local building code requires power independent of the local electric power grid, a pump using an electric motor may utilize, when connected via a listed transfer switch, the installation of an emergency generator. The fire pump starts when the pressure in the fire sprinkler system drops below a threshold. The sprinkler system pressure drops significantly when one or more fire sprinklers are exposed to heat above their design temperature, and opens, releasing water. Alternately, other fire hoses reels or other firefighting connections are opened, causing a pressure drop in the fire fighting main. Fire pumps are needed when the local municipal water system cannot provide sufficient pressure to meet the hydraulic design requirements of the fire sprinkler system. This usually occurs if the building is very tall, such as in high-rise buildings, or in systems that require a relatively high terminal pressure at the fire sprinkler in order to provide a large volume of water, such as in storage warehouses.

Outdoors, it attaches either to a fire engine or a fire hydrant. Indoors, it can permanently attach to a building's standpipe or plumbing system. The usual working pressure of a firehose can vary between 8 and 20 bar (800 and 2,000 kPa; 116 and 290 psi) while per the NFPA 1961 Fire Hose Standard, its bursting pressure is in excess of 110 bar. (11,000kPa; 1600psi)Hose is one of the basic, essential pieces of fire-fighting equipment. It is necessary to convey water either from an open water supply, or pressurized water supply. Hoses are divided into two categories, based on their use: suction hose, and delivery hose. After use, a fire hose is usually hung to dry, because standing water that remains in a hose for a long time can deteriorate the material and render it unreliable or unusable. Therefore, the typical fire station often has a high structure to accommodate the length of a hose for such preventive maintenance, known as a hose tower.

The charging protocol (how much voltage or current for how long, and what to do when charging is complete, for instance) depends on the size and type of the battery being charged. Some battery types have high tolerance for overcharging (i.e., continued charging after the battery has been fully charged) and can be recharged by connection to a constant voltage source or a constant current source, depending on battery type. Simple chargers of this type must be manually disconnected at the end of the charge cycle, and some battery types absolutely require, or may use a timer, to cut off charging current at some fixed time, approximately when charging is complete. Other battery types cannot withstand over-charging, being damaged (reduced capacity, reduced lifetime), over heating or even exploding. The charger may have temperature or voltage sensing circuits and a microprocessor controller to safely adjust the charging current and voltage, determine the state of charge, and cut off at the end of charge. A trickle charger provides a relatively small amount of current, only enough to counteract self-discharge of a battery that is idle for a long time. Some battery types cannot tolerate trickle charging of any kind; attempts to do so may result in damage. Lithium ion battery cells use a chemistry system which does not permit indefinite trickle charging. Slow battery chargers may take several hours to complete a charge. High-rate chargers may restore most capacity much faster, but high rate chargers can be more than some battery types can tolerate. Such batteries require active monitoring of the battery to protect it from overcharging. Electric vehicles ideally need high-rate chargers. For public access, installation of such chargers and the distribution support for them is an issue in the proposed adoption of electric cars."}}, {"@id": "867 RECTIFIERS & CONVERTERS", "@value": {"code": "867", "label": "Rectifiers_&_converters", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "867.001 Rectifiers", "@value": {"code": "867.001", "label": "Rectifiers", "definition": "A rectifier is an electrical device that converts alternating current (AC), which periodically reverses direction, to direct current (DC), which flows in only one direction. The process is known as rectification, since it \"straightens\" the direction of current. Physically, rectifiers take a number of forms, including vacuum tube diodes, wet chemical cells, mercury-arc valves, stacks of copper and selenium oxide plates, semiconductor diodes, silicon-controlled rectifiers and other silicon-based semiconductor switches. Historically, even synchronous electromechanical switches and motors have been used. Early radio receivers, called crystal radios, used a \"cat's whisker\" of fine wire pressing on a crystal of galena (lead sulfide) to serve as a point-contact rectifier or \"crystal detector\". Rectifiers have many uses, but are often found serving as components of DC power supplies and high-voltage direct current power transmission systems. Rectification may serve in roles other than to generate direct current for use as a source of power. As noted, detectors of radio signals serve as rectifiers. In gas heating systems flame rectification is used to detect presence of a flame. Depending on the type of alternating current supply and the arrangement of the rectifier circuit, the output voltage may require additional smoothing to produce a uniform steady voltage. Many applications of rectifiers, such as power supplies for radio, television and computer equipment, require a steady constant DC voltage (as would be produced by a battery). In these applications the output of the rectifier is smoothed by an electronic filter, which may be a capacitor, choke, or set of capacitors, chokes and resistors, possibly followed by a voltage regulator to produce a steady voltage. More complex circuitry that performs the opposite function, that is converting DC to AC, is called an inverter."}}, {"@id": "867.010 Charging rectifiers", "@value": {"code": "867.010", "label":

inner conductor surrounded by a concentric conducting shield, with the two separated by a dielectric (insulating material); many coaxial cables also have a protective outer sheath or jacket. The term \"coaxial\" refers to the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis. Coaxial cable is a type of transmission line, used to carry high frequency electrical signals with low losses. It is used in such applications as telephone trunklines, broadband internet networking cables, high speed computer data busses, cable television signals, and connecting radio transmitters and receivers to their antennas. It differs from other shielded cables because the dimensions of the cable and connectors are controlled to give a precise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a transmission line. Coaxial cable was used in the first (1858) and following transatlantic cable installations, but its theory wasn't described until 1880 by English physicist, engineer, and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, who patented the design in that year (British patent No. 1,407)."}}, {"@id": "886.005 Wide band cables", "@value": {"code": "886.005", "label": "Wide_band_cables", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "886.010 Interference protected cables", "@value": {"code": "886.010", "label": "Interference_protected_cables", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "886.015 Fibre optic cables", "@value": {"code": "886.015", "label": "Fibre_optic_cables", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "886.020 De-gaussing cables", "@value": {"code": "886.020", "label": "De-gaussing_cables", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "89 ELECTRIC CONSUMER SYSTEMS", "@value": {"code": "89", "label": "Electric_consumer_systems", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "891 ELECTRIC LIGHTING SYSTEMS FOR ENGINE & BOILER ROOM", "@value": {"code": "891", "label": "Electric_lighting_systems_for_engine_&_boiler_room", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "891.001 Light fittings", "@value": {"code": "891.001", "label": "Light_fittings", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "891.020 Heating cables", "@value": {"code": "891.020", "label": "Heating_cables", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "891.040 Panel heaters/fans", "@value": {"code": "891.040", "label": "Panel_heaters/fans", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "892 ELECTRIC LIGHTING SYSTEMS FOR ACCOMMODATION", "@value": {"code": "892", "label": "Electric_lighting_systems_for_accommodation", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "892.001 Light fittings", "@value": {"code": "892.001", "label": "Light_fittings", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "892.020 Heating cables", "@value": {"code": "892.020", "label": "Heating_cables", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "892.040 Panel heaters/fans", "@value": {"code": "892.040", "label": "Panel_heaters/fans", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "893 ELECTRIC LIGHTING SYSTEMS FOR DECK & CARGO HOLDS", "@value": {"code": "893", "label": "Electric_lighting_systems_for_deck_&_cargo_holds", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "893.001 General lighting", "@value": {"code": "893.001", "label": "General_lighting", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "893.020 Flood lighting", "@value": {"code": "893.020", "label": "Flood_lighting", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "893.030 Spot lighting", "@value": {"code": "893.030", "label": "Spot_lighting", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "897 (ELECTRIC FANS)", "@value": {"code": "897", "label": "Electric_fans", "definition": ""}}, {"@id": "898 (ELECTRIC MOTORS)", "@value": {"code": "898", "label": "Electric_motors", "definition": "An electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor's magnetic field and electric current in a wire winding to generate force in the form of torque applied on the motor's shaft. Electric motors can be powered by direct current (DC) sources, such as from batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers, or by alternating current (AC) sources, such as a power grid, inverters or electrical generators. An electric generator is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates with a reversed flow of power, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. Electric motors may be classified by considerations such as power source type, internal construction, application and type of motion output. In addition to AC versus DC types, motors may be brushed or brushless, may be of various phase (see single-phase, two-phase, or three-phase), and may be either air-cooled or liquid-cooled. General-purpose motors with standard dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use. The largest electric motors are used for ship propulsion, pipeline compression and pumped-storage applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts. Electric motors are found in industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools and disk drives. Small motors may be found in electric watches. In certain applications, such as in regenerative braking with traction motors, electric motors can be used in reverse as generators to recover energy that might otherwise be lost as heat and friction. Electric motors produce linear or rotary force (torque) intended to propel some external mechanism, such as a fan or an elevator. An electric motor is generally designed for continuous rotation, or for linear movement over a significant distance compared to its size. Magnetic solenoids produce significant mechanical force, but over an operating distance comparable to their size. Transducers such as loudspeakers and microphones convert between electrical current and mechanical force to reproduce signals such as speech. When compared with common internal combustion engines (ICEs), electric motors are lightweight, physically smaller, provide more power output, are mechanically simpler and cheaper to build, while providing instant and consistent torque at any speed, with more responsiveness, higher overall efficiency and lower heat generation. However, electric motors are not as convenient or common as ICEs in mobile applications (i.e. cars and buses) as they require a large and expensive battery, while ICEs require a relatively small fuel tank."}}]
